# KG Explorer Documentation Launch

We are launching the official KG Explorer documentation site. This documentation serves as both a reference guide and a living example of the recursive improvement process.

## What's Included

### Getting Started

Complete guides for:
- [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) - Set up FalkorDB, Graphiti, and KG Explorer
- [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) - Get exploring in 5 minutes
- [First Query](/docs/getting-started/first-query) - Write your first graph queries

### Core Concepts

Understanding the foundations:
- [Knowledge Graphs](/docs/concepts/knowledge-graphs) - Graph theory and temporal modeling
- [Ontology Design](/docs/concepts/ontology-design) - The schema powering KG Explorer
- [Recursive Improvement](/docs/concepts/recursive-improvement) - How the system improves itself
- [Singularity Factors](/docs/concepts/singularity-factors) - Acceleration mechanisms

### Practical Guides

Hands-on tutorials:
- [Writing Queries](/docs/guides/writing-queries) - Advanced Cypher patterns
- [Interpreting Insights](/docs/guides/interpreting-insights) - Understanding automated analysis
- [Ontology Evolution](/docs/guides/ontology-evolution) - Extending the schema
- [Contributing Data](/docs/guides/contributing-data) - Adding to the knowledge graph

### API Reference

Complete technical reference:
- [GraphQL Schema](/docs/api/graphql-schema) - Typed query interface
- [REST Endpoints](/docs/api/rest-endpoints) - HTTP API
- [WebSocket Events](/docs/api/websocket-events) - Real-time updates

### Architecture

System design documentation:
- [System Overview](/docs/architecture/system-overview) - High-level architecture
- [Data Pipeline](/docs/architecture/data-pipeline) - Ingestion and extraction
- [Agent System](/docs/architecture/agent-system) - Autonomous improvement agents
- [Performance](/docs/architecture/performance) - Optimization strategies

## Interactive Components

The documentation includes interactive components for hands-on learning:

- **GraphPreview** - Explore sample knowledge graphs
- **QueryPlayground** - Try queries without leaving the docs
- **InsightExplorer** - Browse example insights

## Documentation as Knowledge Graph

This documentation itself participates in the recursive improvement process:

1. **Observation**: Track which docs are read, which cause confusion
2. **Analysis**: Identify documentation gaps
3. **Synthesis**: Propose additions or clarifications
4. **Implementation**: Update documentation
5. **Validation**: Check comprehension via feedback

The documentation is a knowledge graph of the system - and it improves alongside the system it documents.

## What's Next

The documentation will continue to evolve with the system:

- Additional iteration logs as improvements are made
- Expanded API documentation
- More interactive examples
- Community contributions

## Get Involved

- Browse the [Iteration Log](/iterations) to see how the system has evolved
- [Contribute data](/docs/guides/contributing-data) to expand the knowledge graph
- Open issues for documentation improvements
