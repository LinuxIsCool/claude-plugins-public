# Singularity Factors

Mechanisms where improvement accelerates improvement.

## Factor 1: Knowledge Density

As the graph grows denser, entity extraction improves. More context enables better disambiguation.

## Factor 2: Query Intelligence

Successful query patterns train the natural language interface. Better understanding generates better queries.

## Factor 3: Observation Coverage

More users reveal more query patterns, enabling more targeted improvements.

## Factor 4: Compound Learning

The system learns from its own outputs, generating meta-insights about its improvement process.

## Factor 5: Documentation Feedback

This documentation participates in recursive improvement. Documentation gaps reveal system gaps.

## Factor 6: Agent Collaboration

Multiple agents observe different aspects. Combined observations reveal system-level patterns.

## Measuring Acceleration

```
Acceleration = (Improvement Rate T2 - Improvement Rate T1) / Time

If Acceleration > 0: System is accelerating
```
