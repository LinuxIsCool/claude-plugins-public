Member-owned, democratically governed business structures in Canada, with focus on BC Cooperative Association Act.

## Entity Overview

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Primary Use** | Member-owned business serving members' needs |
| **Liability** | Limited (cooperative is separate legal entity) |
| **Taxation** | Patronage dividends deductible; members taxed |
| **Governance** | One member, one vote (typically) |
| **Duration** | Perpetual existence |

## Cooperative Principles

International Cooperative Alliance principles:

1. **Voluntary and open membership**
2. **Democratic member control**
3. **Member economic participation**
4. **Autonomy and independence**
5. **Education, training, and information**
6. **Cooperation among cooperatives**
7. **Concern for community**

## Types of Cooperatives

### Worker Cooperatives

**Ownership**: Employee-members own and govern
**Purpose**: Provide employment; share profits with workers
**Governance**: Democratic (one worker, one vote)
**Examples**: Restaurants, design studios, tech companies, trades

**Benefits**:
- Aligned incentives (workers = owners)
- Democratic workplace
- Profit sharing
- Resilience (members invested in success)

### Consumer Cooperatives

**Ownership**: Customer-members own and govern
**Purpose**: Provide goods/services to members
**Governance**: One member, one vote
**Examples**: Credit unions, food co-ops, REI (in US)

**Benefits**:
- Members control what they purchase
- Profits returned to members (patronage dividends)
- Often values-driven (local, sustainable)

### Producer/Marketing Cooperatives

**Ownership**: Producer-members (farmers, artisans)
**Purpose**: Collectively market members' products
**Governance**: One member, one vote
**Examples**: Dairy cooperatives, grain pools, craft collectives

**Benefits**:
- Collective bargaining power
- Shared marketing costs
- Quality standards

### Housing Cooperatives

**Ownership**: Resident-members own shares, not units
**Purpose**: Provide affordable housing
**Governance**: Democratic (member board)
**Examples**: Non-profit housing co-ops throughout Canada

**Special Considerations**:
- No individual ownership of units
- Members hold occupancy rights
- Cannot sell unit for profit (non-equity co-ops)
- Equity co-ops allow appreciation

### Multi-Stakeholder Cooperatives

**Ownership**: Multiple stakeholder classes
**Purpose**: Serve diverse stakeholders together
**Governance**: Each class may have representation
**Examples**: Community-owned enterprises, care co-ops

**Structure**:
- Worker members
- Consumer members
- Producer members
- Community/investor members
- Each class may have board seats

## Worker Cooperative Deep Dive

### Membership Requirements

Typically:
- Probation period (6-12 months)
- Purchase membership share
- Vote of existing members
- Ongoing participation requirements

### Compensation Structures

**Equal Pay**: All workers paid same
**Ratio Limits**: E.g., highest paid ≤ 3x lowest
**Market-Based**: Competitive wages within limits
**Hybrid**: Base wage + patronage share

### Governance Best Practices

**Decision Types**:
- Operational (manager/committee)
- Policy (board)
- Constitutional (membership)

**Consensus vs Voting**:
- Many co-ops use consensus for major decisions
- Voting as fallback
- Supermajority for key issues

### Financing Challenges

**Traditional Barriers**:
- Banks unfamiliar with co-op model
- No traditional equity to sell
- Limited collateral

**Solutions**:
- Member loans
- Community bonds
- Credit union financing (co-op to co-op)
- Government programs (varies by province)
- Investment shares (where permitted)

## Housing Cooperative Deep Dive

### Equity vs Non-Equity

**Non-Equity Co-op**:
- Member pays housing charge (rent equivalent)
- No appreciation/profit on leaving
- Often involves government subsidy
- True affordable housing

**Equity Co-op**:
- Member purchases share at market value
- Share appreciates with market
- Can profit on sale
- Limited equity caps appreciation

### Governance

**Board**: Elected from residents
**Committees**: Maintenance, finance, social, etc.
**Participation**: Often required (e.g., 4 hours/month)

### Financial Model

**Housing Charge**: Covers operating costs, reserve fund
**Reserve Fund**: Required for major repairs
**Operating Budget**: No profit motive

## Common Scenarios

- Profits distributed as patronage based on hours/contribution
- Probation period before membership

**Benefits**:
- Aligned incentives
- Retention through ownership

- Member-elected board
- Professional management
- Committees for engagement

### Housing Co-op Development

**Structure**: Non-equity housing co-op
- Members hold occupancy rights
- Housing charges cover costs

1. Group formation
2. Site acquisition
3. Development financing

5. Occupancy and ongoing management

### Multi-Stakeholder Care Co-op

**Structure**: Multi-stakeholder co-op
- Worker members (caregivers)

- Community members (broader stakeholders)

**Governance**:
- Board seats allocated by class
- Different rights for different classes
- Balance of interests

## Cooperative vs Other Structures

### When to Choose Cooperative

**Good Fit**:

- Patronage-based returns make sense
- Long-term community orientation
- Worker ownership desired

**Poor Fit**:
- Need external investment
- Rapid scaling planned
- Exit via sale expected
- One person wants control
- Members won't participate

### Hybrid Possibilities

**Cooperative + Subsidiary Corporation**:

**Cooperative + Trust**:
