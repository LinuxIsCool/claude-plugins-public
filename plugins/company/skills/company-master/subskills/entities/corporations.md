# Corporations

Canadian corporate structures, with primary focus on BC Business Corporations Act (BCBCA) and federal Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA).

## Entity Overview

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Primary Use** | For-profit business activities with limited liability |
| **Liability** | Limited to corporate assets; shareholders' personal assets protected |
| **Taxation** | Separate taxpayer; corporate income tax rates apply |
| **Governance** | Directors manage; shareholders own |
| **Duration** | Perpetual existence |

## Incorporation Decision: BC vs Federal

### BC Incorporation (BCBCA)

**Advantages**:
- Lower annual filing costs (~$45/year vs ~$20 federal but more complex)
- Single registry to deal with
- BC Corporate Registry is efficient
- Good for purely BC operations

**Disadvantages**:
- Must extra-provincially register if operating in other provinces
- Each province has different requirements and fees
- Name protection only in BC

**Best For**: Businesses operating primarily in BC with no immediate plans for national expansion.

### Federal Incorporation (CBCA)

**Advantages**:
- Name protection across Canada
- Right to carry on business in any province (still need registration but simplified)
- Some perceived prestige/legitimacy
- May be preferred by some investors/partners

**Disadvantages**:
- Must register in each province where operating anyway
- Two registries to maintain (federal + provincial)
- Slightly more complex annual filings

**Best For**: Businesses planning national operations, seeking investment, or wanting national name protection.

### Use Cases

- US parent wants Canadian operations

- Simplify cross-border structuring

### Warning

ULCs are specialized vehicles. Not appropriate for typical Canadian businesses due to unlimited liability exposure.

- Defer capital gains
- Requires joint election with corporation
- Consideration must include shares

### Estate Freezes

- "Freeze" current value at parent generation

- Tax-deferred if proper elections
- Useful for corporate simplification

## Compliance Requirements

### LCGE Planning
