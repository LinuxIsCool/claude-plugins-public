# Trusts

Trust structures in Canada, with focus on estate planning, income splitting, and tax deferral strategies.

## Entity Overview

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Primary Use** | Estate planning, income splitting, asset protection |
| **Liability** | Trust property separate from trustee personal assets |
| **Taxation** | Generally taxed at top marginal rate unless income distributed |
| **Governance** | Trustees manage for beneficiaries |
| **Duration** | 21-year deemed disposition rule applies |

## Trust Fundamentals

### Three Certainties

For a valid trust:
1. **Certainty of intention**: Clear intent to create a trust
2. **Certainty of subject matter**: Specific property identified
3. **Certainty of objects**: Identifiable beneficiaries

### Key Players

**Settlor**: Creates the trust, transfers initial property
**Trustee**: Manages trust property for beneficiaries
**Beneficiaries**: Receive benefits from trust property/income

### Trust Deed

The governing document that specifies:
- Trustees and their powers
- Beneficiaries (specific or classes)
- Distribution provisions
- Investment powers
- Amendment and termination

## Types of Trusts

### Inter Vivos (Living) Trusts

Created during settlor's lifetime.

**Family Trust**:
- Most common for tax planning
- Beneficiaries typically family members
- Income splitting opportunities
- Estate freeze vehicle

**Asset Protection Trust**:
- Protect assets from creditors
- Must be created before debt/liability arises
- Caution: Can be challenged if fraudulent conveyance

### Testamentary Trusts

Created by will, takes effect on death.

**Spousal Trust**:
- Income to surviving spouse for life
- Capital to children on spouse's death
- Tax deferral until spouse's death

**Family Testamentary Trust**:
- For children or other beneficiaries
- Can provide for minor children
- Spendthrift provisions possible

### Special Trust Types

**Alter Ego Trust**:
- Settlor must be 65+ at creation
- Settlor is sole beneficiary during lifetime
- No deemed disposition on transfer to trust
- Deemed disposition on settlor's death

**Joint Partner Trust**:
- Both spouses must be 65+
- Both are beneficiaries during joint lives
- Surviving spouse continues as beneficiary
- Deemed disposition on survivor's death

**Qualified Disability Trust (QDT)**:
- For beneficiary with disability tax credit
- Taxed at graduated rates (not flat top rate)
- Must elect annually

## Tax Treatment

### General Rule

Trusts are taxed at the top marginal rate (53.5% in BC for 2025) on retained income.

### Income Attribution Rules

**Be Aware**:
- Income from property transferred to spouse may attribute back
- Income from property transferred to minors may attribute back
- Complex rules - consult tax professional

### 21-Year Rule

**Critical Planning Point**:

Every 21 years, a trust is deemed to dispose of all capital property at fair market value.

**Implications**:
- Capital gains triggered
- May require liquidity planning
- Consider rollovers to beneficiaries before 21-year mark

**Planning Options**:
- Distribute property to capital beneficiaries before anniversary
- Select principal residence exemption strategically
- Consider insurance funding for tax liability

### Graduated Rate Estates

For first 36 months after death, testamentary trusts can elect to be Graduated Rate Estates:
- Taxed at graduated rates (not top rate)
- Off-calendar fiscal year-end
- Only one per deceased individual

## Family Trust Planning

### Income Splitting Benefits

Distribute income to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets.

**Example**:
- Trust earns $50,000 investment income
- Retained in trust: ~$26,750 tax (53.5% in BC)
- Distributed to adult child with no other income: ~$3,000 tax

**Restrictions (TOSI)**:
Tax on Split Income (TOSI) rules significantly limit income splitting with:
- Minor children (all income)
- Adult family members (business income from related business)

Generally safe:
- Capital gains from arm's length sale of QSBC shares
- Property income to adults 25+ not involved in related business

### Estate Freeze Using Trust

**Structure**:
1. Existing shareholder exchanges growth shares for fixed-value preferred shares
2. Family trust subscribes for new common shares (nominal value)
3. Future growth accrues to trust (beneficiaries)
4. Original shareholder's value frozen

**Benefits**:
- Freeze estate value for tax purposes
- Future growth to next generation
- Flexibility on ultimate distribution
- Probate avoidance (trust property)

**LCGE Multiplication**:
Family trust can allocate QSBC gains to multiple beneficiaries, each using their own LCGE (~$1M each).

### Protecting Assets

Trust property is generally:
- Protected from beneficiary's creditors (if properly structured)
- Excluded from beneficiary's marriage breakdown (if designated)
- Outside beneficiary's estate (probate avoided)

## Trust Administration

### Trustee Duties

**Fiduciary Duties**:
- Act in best interests of beneficiaries
- Impartiality between beneficiaries
- Invest prudently
- Account to beneficiaries

**Record Keeping**:
- Trust deed and amendments
- Financial records
- Distribution decisions
- Tax filings

### Annual Requirements

- T3 Trust Income Tax Return (due 90 days after year-end)
- Distribution decisions documented
- Beneficiary allocations reported (T3 slips)
- Maintain trust records

### Trust Reporting Rules (New)

Enhanced reporting for most trusts (effective 2023):
- Beneficial ownership disclosure
- Extended filing requirements
- Penalties for non-compliance
- Some exceptions (bare trusts, qualifying arrangements)

## Common Scenarios

### Estate Planning for Business Owner

**Structure**: Estate freeze with family trust
1. Exchange common shares for preferred shares
2. New common shares issued to family trust
3. Beneficiaries: spouse, children, grandchildren
4. Trustees: founder + professional trustee

**Benefits**:
- Freeze current value for founder's estate
- Future growth to family
- LCGE multiplication on sale
- Flexibility in ultimate distribution

### Income Splitting for Professionals

**Caution**: TOSI rules significantly limit this

**Structure**: Family trust holding professional corporation shares

**TOSI Complications**:
- Dividends to spouse/adult children may be TOSI if they're not significantly involved
- Need to demonstrate exclusions (over 25 and not related business, arm's length sale, etc.)

### Cottage/Vacation Property

**Structure**: Alter ego or joint partner trust (if 65+)

**Benefits**:
- No deemed disposition on transfer to trust
- Probate avoidance
- No tax until death
- Simple succession

**Alternative**: Joint partner trust for couples

### Supporting Child with Disability

**Structure**: Qualified Disability Trust (QDT)

**Benefits**:
- Graduated tax rates (vs top rate)
- Asset protection
- Supplement government benefits (if structured properly)

## Trust vs Corporation Comparison

| Factor | Family Trust | CCPC |
|--------|--------------|------|
| Tax rate on retained income | Top marginal (~53%) | 11-27% |
| Income splitting | Limited (TOSI) | Limited (TOSI) |
| Capital gains flow-through | Yes | No (must sell corporate assets) |
| LCGE multiplication | Yes | No |
| 21-year rule | Yes | No |
| Probate avoidance | Yes | Depends |
| Flexibility | High (discretionary) | Lower (defined shares) |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Ignoring 21-year rule**: Plan distributions before anniversary
2. **Trustee selection**: Choosing inappropriate or conflicted trustees
3. **Failing to document**: Informal distributions without proper records
4. **TOSI non-compliance**: Assuming all income splitting still works
5. **Bare trust confusion**: Thinking bare trusts avoid reporting requirements
6. **Over-engineering**: Complex trust structures for simple situations
