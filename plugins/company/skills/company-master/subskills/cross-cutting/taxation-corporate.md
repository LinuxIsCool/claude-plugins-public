# Corporate Taxation (Canada)

Canadian corporate income tax fundamentals with focus on CCPC (Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation) planning and integration.

## 2025 Corporate Tax Rates

### Federal Rates

| Income Type | Rate |
|-------------|------|
| General Corporate Rate | 15% |
| Small Business Rate (CCPC) | 9% |
| M&P Rate | 15% |
| Investment Income (CCPC) | 38.67% (with refund mechanism) |

### BC Provincial Rates

| Income Type | Rate |
|-------------|------|
| General Rate | 12% |
| Small Business Rate | 2% |

### Combined Rates (Federal + BC)

| Income Type | Combined Rate |
|-------------|---------------|
| General Active Business | 27% |
| Small Business (CCPC) | 11% |
| Investment Income (CCPC) | ~50.67% (before refund) |

## CCPC Status

### Qualification Requirements

1. **Canadian-Controlled**: More than 50% votes held by Canadian residents
2. **Private**: Not publicly traded
3. **Not Controlled by**:
   - Public corporation
   - Non-resident
   - Combination of above

### Why CCPC Matters

**Tax Benefits**:
- Small Business Deduction (SBD)
- Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)
- Refundable Investment Tax Credits
- Scientific Research (SR&ED) enhanced credit

**Maintaining Status**:
- Monitor shareholder residency
- Careful with bringing in foreign investors
- Watch for deemed public company rules

## Small Business Deduction (SBD)

### The Benefit

**2025 Rates**:
- Without SBD: 27% (15% federal + 12% BC)
- With SBD: 11% (9% federal + 2% BC)
- Tax Savings: 16% on first $500,000

### Eligibility

**Business Limit**: $500,000 of active business income

**Active Business Income**:
- Income from business carried on actively
- NOT: Investment income (rental, interest, dividends, capital gains)
- NOT: Specified investment business (≤5 FT employees)
- NOT: Personal services business (incorporated employee)

### Grind Mechanisms

**Passive Income Grind**:
- $50,000 threshold for adjusted aggregate investment income (AAII)
- SBD reduced by $5 for every $1 over threshold
- At $150,000 AAII, SBD fully eliminated

**Taxable Capital Grind**:
- Business limit starts reducing at $10M taxable capital
- Eliminated at $15M taxable capital
- Includes associated corporations

### Associated Corporations

Associated corporations share one $500,000 business limit.

**Associated if**:
- Same person controls both
- Related group controls both
- Cross-ownership patterns

**Planning**: Avoid unintended association through careful structuring.

## Investment Income Taxation

### The High Rate

CCPC investment income taxed at high rate (~50.67% in BC) because:
- Prevents indefinite tax deferral on passive income
- Integration maintained through refund mechanism

### Refundable Taxes

**RDTOH (Refundable Dividend Tax on Hand)**:
- Part of high corporate tax is refundable
- Refunded when taxable dividends paid out
- $38.33 refund per $100 of taxable dividends (approximately)

**Two RDTOH Accounts**:
- ERDTOH (Eligible): From portfolio dividends received
- NERDTOH (Non-Eligible): From other investment income

### Investment Types

| Type | Corporate Rate | Personal Rate | Integration |
|------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Interest | ~50.67% | N/A (paid out) | Imperfect |
| Capital Gains | ~25.33% (50% inclusion) | Via CDA | Good |
| Eligible Dividends | Refundable | Via GRIP | Good |
| Non-Eligible Dividends | Refundable | Via NERDTOH | Good |

### Capital Dividend Account (CDA)

**Tax-Free Extraction**:
- 50% of capital gains (non-taxable portion)
- Life insurance proceeds (net of ACB)
- Capital dividends received from other corporations

**How It Works**:
- Track CDA balance
- Elect to pay capital dividends
- Received tax-free by shareholders

## Salary vs Dividend Decision

### Comparison Framework

| Factor | Salary | Dividend |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Creates RRSP Room | Yes (18% of salary) | No |
| CPP Contributions | Yes (employee + employer) | No |
| Corporate Deduction | Yes | No |
| Payroll Taxes | EI, possibly WCB | No |
| Integration | Perfect | Near-perfect |
| Cash Flexibility | Must pay in year | Can defer |

### Detailed Analysis

**Scenario**: $200,000 corporate profit, personal needs $100,000

**Option A: Salary**
- Pay $100,000 salary
- Corporate deduction: $100,000
- Corporate tax on remaining $100,000: $11,000 (SBD rate)
- Personal tax on salary: ~$28,000 (BC, single)
- RRSP room created: $18,000
- CPP contributed: $7,735 (employee + employer)
- Net cash to individual: ~$72,000

**Option B: Dividend**
- No corporate deduction
- Corporate tax on $200,000: $22,000 (SBD on all)
- After-tax corporate: $178,000
- Pay $100,000 non-eligible dividend
- Personal tax: ~$15,000 (BC, single, with credits)
- No RRSP room created
- No CPP
- Net cash to individual: ~$85,000

**Integration Insight**: With dividend, more cash now, but less retirement savings infrastructure.

### Planning Guidelines

**Favor Salary When**:
- Need RRSP contribution room
- Building CPP entitlements
- Have childcare expenses (requires earned income)
- Support payments require income

**Favor Dividends When**:
- Already maximized RRSP
- No need for CPP (other pension)
- Want to retain funds in corporation
- Flexibility on timing

**Common Strategy**: Pay enough salary for desired RRSP room, then balance with dividends.

## GRIP and ERDTOH

### GRIP (General Rate Income Pool)

**Purpose**: Track corporate income taxed at general rate (27%, not SBD rate).

**Why It Matters**: Dividends paid from GRIP can be "eligible dividends" with better integration.

**GRIP Sources**:
- Active business income over $500,000 (taxed at general rate)
- Eligible dividends received from public companies
- Eligible dividends received from other CCPCs

### ERDTOH (Eligible Refundable Dividend Tax on Hand)

**Purpose**: Track refundable taxes paid on portfolio dividend income.

**Refund**: When eligible dividends paid out, ERDTOH refunded first.

### Dividend Planning

**Non-Eligible Dividends** (from SBD income):
- Lower gross-up (15%)
- Lower tax credit
- Higher effective personal tax rate

**Eligible Dividends** (from GRIP):
- Higher gross-up (38%)
- Higher tax credit
- Lower effective personal tax rate

**Strategy**: If GRIP available, pay eligible dividends for better integration.

## Corporate Structures

### Holding Company (Holdco)

**Purpose**:
- Protect business assets
- Investment management
- Estate planning
- Crystallize LCGE

**Structure**:
```
Shareholder
    |
Holdco (holds investments, real estate)
    |
Opco (operating business)
```

**Inter-Corporate Dividends**:
- Generally flow tax-free between connected corporations
- Complex rules for certain situations

### Operating Company (Opco)

**Best Practices**:
- Keep lean (minimal excess assets)
- Regular dividend to Holdco (protect assets)
- Maintain CCPC status

### Family Trust Structure

See trusts.md for detailed analysis.

**Purpose**: LCGE multiplication, income splitting (limited by TOSI).

## Tax Planning Strategies

### Income Timing

**Bonus Accrual**:
- Accrue bonus before year-end
- Deduct in corporation's year
- Pay within 180 days
- Shareholder reports when received

**Year-End Selection**:
- Non-calendar year-end can optimize tax deferral
- Consider personal income patterns

### Loss Utilization

**Non-Capital Losses**:
- Carry back 3 years, forward 20 years
- Use against any income type

**Capital Losses**:
- Carry back 3 years, forward indefinitely
- Use only against capital gains

**Allowable Business Investment Losses (ABILs)**:
- 50% of loss on CCPC shares/debt
- Can offset other income

### SR&ED Credits

**Scientific Research and Experimental Development**:
- 35% refundable credit (CCPC, first $3M)
- 15% non-refundable (over $3M, or non-CCPC)
- Must meet definition of SR&ED
- Document contemporaneously

## Compliance Requirements

### Annual Filings

**T2 Corporate Tax Return**:
- Due 6 months after fiscal year-end
- Balance due 2 months after year-end (3 months for CCPC with SBD)
- Late filing penalties and interest apply

**Schedules**:
- Schedule 1: Net income reconciliation
- Schedule 3: Dividends received/paid
- Schedule 7: GRIP and LRIP
- Schedule 8: CCA (depreciation)
- Various others depending on activities

### Installments

**Monthly or Quarterly**:
- Based on prior year taxes
- Avoid interest charges
- First-year corporations exempt (under $3,000 threshold)

## Common Scenarios

### Professional Corporation

**Structure**: Professional (doctor, lawyer, accountant) incorporates practice
**Benefits**: Income deferral, limited SBD access
**Considerations**: TOSI limits family income splitting

### Real Estate Business

**Issue**: Often classified as investment income (specified investment business)
**Solution**: Employ 5+ full-time employees, or structure as active business
**Alternative**: Keep outside corporation; may not benefit from SBD anyway

### Business Sale Planning

**Pre-Sale**: Purify for LCGE (remove passive investments)
**During Sale**: Share sale vs asset sale considerations
**Post-Sale**: Safe income rules, investment planning
