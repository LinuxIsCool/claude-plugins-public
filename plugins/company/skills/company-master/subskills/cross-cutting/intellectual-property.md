# Intellectual Property

Canadian IP law framework for protecting and commercializing intellectual property.

## Types of Intellectual Property

### Patents

**What They Protect**: New, useful, and non-obvious inventions

**Requirements**:
1. **Novelty**: Not publicly disclosed anywhere in the world
2. **Utility**: Functional and works as described
3. **Non-Obviousness**: Not obvious to someone skilled in the field

**Duration**: 20 years from filing date

**Rights Granted**: Exclusive right to make, use, and sell the invention

**What Can Be Patented**:
- Processes and methods
- Machines and devices
- Compositions of matter
- Improvements to existing inventions
- Software (in certain implementations)

**What Cannot Be Patented**:
- Abstract ideas
- Scientific principles
- Mathematical formulas (alone)
- Higher life forms (in Canada)
- Methods of medical treatment (in Canada)

### Trademarks

**What They Protect**: Brands, names, logos, sounds, distinctive identifiers

**Requirements**:
1. **Distinctiveness**: Identifies source of goods/services
2. **Not Confusing**: With existing marks
3. **Not Prohibited**: Certain marks cannot be registered

**Duration**: 10 years, renewable indefinitely

**Types**:
- Word marks (name only)
- Design marks (logo)
- Combination marks
- Sound marks
- Certification marks
- Distinguishing guises (trade dress)

**Registration Benefits**:
- Nationwide protection
- Presumption of validity
- Enhanced remedies
- Easier enforcement
- Use of ® symbol

### Copyright

**What It Protects**: Original creative works fixed in tangible form

**Requirements**:
1. **Originality**: Product of author's skill and judgment
2. **Fixation**: Recorded in some form

**Duration**:
- General: Life + 70 years (changed from 50 in 2022)
- Corporate works: 75 years from publication
- Sound recordings: 70 years from fixation

**What's Protected**:
- Literary works (including software code)
- Artistic works
- Musical works
- Dramatic works
- Sound recordings
- Performances
- Communication signals

**No Registration Required**: Copyright exists automatically on creation

**Registration Benefits**:
- Evidence of ownership
- Presumption of validity
- Required for some legal actions

### Trade Secrets

**What They Protect**: Confidential business information with commercial value

**Requirements**:
1. **Secrecy**: Not generally known
2. **Value**: Derives value from secrecy
3. **Reasonable Efforts**: To maintain secrecy

**Duration**: Indefinite (as long as secret maintained)

**Examples**:
- Formulas
- Processes
- Customer lists
- Business strategies
- Algorithms
- Negative know-how

**Protection Methods**:
- Non-disclosure agreements
- Access controls
- Employee agreements
- Physical security
- Technical measures

## IP Strategy

### Build vs. License

**Build (Own)**:
- Full control and ownership
- Higher upfront investment
- Long-term asset
- Can license to others

**License (Use)**:
- Lower upfront cost
- Faster to market
- Dependent on licensor
- Ongoing royalties

### Patent Strategy

**Offensive Patents**:
- Block competitors
- Generate licensing revenue
- Increase valuation
- M&A leverage

**Defensive Patents**:
- Freedom to operate
- Deterrent against litigation
- Cross-licensing currency

**Patent Timing**:
```
Invention → Trade Secret → Patent Application → Publication → Grant
           (secrecy)       (priority date)     (18 months)  (2-5 years)
```

**Grace Period** (Canada): 12 months from own disclosure
- But: Most other countries require absolute novelty

### Trademark Strategy

**Selection Criteria**:
1. **Availability**: Clearance search
2. **Distinctiveness**: Stronger = better protection
3. **Scalability**: Works across products/markets
4. **Defensibility**: Easy to enforce

**Strength Spectrum** (weakest to strongest):
- Generic: "Computer" for computers (unprotectable)
- Descriptive: "Quick Print" for printing (weak)
- Suggestive: "Coppertone" for suntan lotion (moderate)
- Arbitrary: "Apple" for computers (strong)
- Fanciful: "Xerox" (strongest)

### Copyright Strategy

**For Software**:
- Protects specific expression (code)
- Does not protect functionality
- Consider patents for algorithms
- Open source licensing considerations

**For Content**:
- Clear ownership chain
- Contributor agreements
- Work-for-hire provisions
- License terms

1. Complete application
2. Submit to CIPO
3. Registration issued

**Costs**: $50-$65 (online/mail)
**Timeline**: 1-4 weeks

## Ownership Issues

### Employment

**Default Rule**: Employer owns IP created in course of employment

**Considerations**:
- Scope of employment
- Time of creation
- Use of employer resources

**Best Practice**: Clear IP assignment provisions in employment agreement

### Contractors

**Default Rule**: Contractor typically retains ownership

**Critical**: Must have written IP assignment agreement

**Assignment Language**:
```
Contractor hereby assigns all right, title, and interest in
and to all Intellectual Property created in connection with
the Services to the Company.
```

### Joint Development

**Risks**:
- Unclear ownership
- Each party may use independently
- Licensing complications

**Solution**: Clear joint development agreement specifying:
- Ownership allocation
- Use rights
- Licensing rights
- Improvement rights

### Pre-Existing IP

**Issue**: Contractor uses their pre-existing IP in deliverables

**Solution**:
- Identify pre-existing IP
- Grant perpetual license
- Or acquire assignment

## Licensing

### License Types

**Exclusive**: Only licensee can use (even licensor cannot)
**Sole**: Only licensee and licensor can use
**Non-Exclusive**: Multiple licensees possible

### Key License Terms

**Grant Clause**: What rights are being licensed
**Field of Use**: Limited to specific applications
**Territory**: Geographic limitations
**Term**: Duration of license
**Royalty**: Payment structure

**Typical Royalty Structures**:
- Percentage of revenue (2-10% typical)
- Per-unit fees
- Lump sum
- Minimum guarantees
- Milestone payments

### IP Due Diligence

**For Acquisitions/Investments**:
- [ ] Chain of title verification
- [ ] Registration status
- [ ] Assignment records
- [ ] Employee/contractor agreements
- [ ] Third-party licenses (in and out)
- [ ] Encumbrances (liens, security interests)
- [ ] Litigation history
- [ ] Freedom to operate analysis

## Enforcement

### Patent Infringement

**Direct Infringement**: Making, using, selling patented invention

**Indirect Infringement**: Inducing or contributing to infringement

**Remedies**:
- Injunction
- Damages (lost profits or reasonable royalty)
- Accounting of profits
- Delivery up

### Trademark Infringement

**Test**: Likelihood of confusion considering:
- Similarity of marks
- Similarity of goods/services
- Distinctiveness of mark
- Evidence of actual confusion

**Remedies**: Similar to patent plus brand damage claims

### Copyright Infringement

**Elements**:
- Copying occurred
- Substantial similarity
- No valid defense (fair dealing, etc.)

**Statutory Damages** (Canada):
- Commercial: $500-$20,000 per work
- Non-commercial: $100-$5,000 total

### Trade Secret Misappropriation

**Claims**:
- Breach of confidence
- Breach of contract
- Inducing breach

**Remedies**:
- Injunction
- Damages
- Accounting of profits

## IP and Financing

### IP as Collateral

**Security Interests**: IP can secure financing

**Registration Requirements**:
- Patents: CIPO
- Trademarks: CIPO
- Copyright: CIPO
- Also PPSA/civil code registry

### IP Valuation

**Methods**:
- Cost approach (development costs)
- Market approach (comparable transactions)
- Income approach (DCF of expected revenue)

**Factors**:
- Legal strength
- Market position
- Remaining life
- License revenue
- Competitive advantage

### Due Diligence for Investment

**Investor Concerns**:
- Clear ownership
- No encumbrances
- Freedom to operate
- Defensibility
- Maintenance status

## Tax Considerations

### SR&ED

**Scientific Research and Experimental Development**:
- Federal credit: 15% refundable (CCPCs up to $3M limit)
- BC credit: 10% (refundable for CCPCs)

**Eligible Activities**:
- Basic research
- Applied research
- Experimental development

**Documentation**: Must support claim with technical and financial records

### IP Holdings

**Canadian IP Regime**:
- No patent box regime in Canada
- IP income taxed at regular rates
- Consider provincial rate variations

**International Considerations**:
- IP holding companies in low-tax jurisdictions
- Transfer pricing on IP transfers
- FAPI rules for offshore IP

## Startup Considerations

### Priority Actions

**Week 1**:
- [ ] File provisional patent (if applicable)
- [ ] Clear trademark
- [ ] Document trade secrets

**Month 1**:
- [ ] Employee IP agreements
- [ ] Contractor IP agreements
- [ ] Trademark application

**Year 1**:
- [ ] Full patent applications
- [ ] International trademark strategy
- [ ] IP audit

### Common Mistakes

1. **Public Disclosure**: Before filing patents
2. **No Assignments**: From founders, contractors
3. **Weak NDAs**: Or none at all
4. **Generic Marks**: Choosing weak trademarks
5. **No Documentation**: Of trade secrets
6. **Ignoring Freedom to Operate**: Building on others' IP
