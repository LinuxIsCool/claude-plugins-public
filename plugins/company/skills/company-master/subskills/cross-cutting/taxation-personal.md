## Income Splitting Strategies

### Tax on Split Income (TOSI) Rules

**The Challenge**: TOSI rules tax split income at top marginal rate.

**Applies To**:
- Dividends from private corporations to family members
- Interest income from related party loans
- Income from trusts

**Exclusions** (income NOT subject to TOSI):
- Arm's length employment income
- Capital gains from sale of QSBC shares
- Reasonable salary for actual work
- Income to spouse 65+ from RRSP/pension
- Property income to adults 25+ not involved in related business

### Legal Splitting Strategies

**Spousal RRSP**:
- Higher earner contributes to spouse's RRSP
- Deduction to contributor
- Income taxed to spouse on withdrawal (after 3 years)

**Pension Income Splitting**:
- Can split up to 50% of eligible pension income
- Both spouses must be 65+ (or earlier for company pension)

**Prescribed Rate Loans**:
- Lend to lower-income spouse at CRA prescribed rate
- Spouse invests, earns income taxed at lower rate
- Must charge and receive interest annually

**Family Trust** (with TOSI limitations):
- See trusts.md for detailed analysis
- Significantly restricted by TOSI

## Capital Gains Planning

### 50% Inclusion Rate

Only 50% of capital gains included in income.

**Effective Rates** (BC 2025):
- Low income: ~10%
- High income: 26.75% (53.5% × 50%)

### Principal Residence Exemption

One property per family can be designated as principal residence:
- No capital gains tax on qualifying gains
- Must be "ordinarily inhabited" during ownership
- Includes up to 0.5 hectare (larger if necessary for enjoyment)

**Designation Strategy**:
- Track ACB of all properties
- Designate property with highest gain per year of ownership
- Formula: Gain × (1 + years designated) / years owned

### Capital Gains Reserves

Can spread gain over up to 5 years if:
- Proceeds not received in year of sale
- At least 20% recognized each year
- Related party sales: no reserve

### Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)

See exit-strategies.md for detailed LCGE planning.

**2025 Limit**: $1,016,836 for QSBC shares
**Requirements**: CCPC shares, 24-month hold, asset tests

## Dividend Taxation

### Gross-Up and Tax Credit

Dividends grossed up, then credit applied.

**Eligible Dividends** (from large corporations, CCPC's general rate income):
- Gross-up: 38%
- Federal credit: 15.02%
- BC credit: 12%

**Non-Eligible Dividends** (from CCPC's small business income):
- Gross-up: 15%
- Federal credit: 9.03%
- BC credit: 2%

### Integration Principle

Tax on corporate income + personal tax on dividends should roughly equal tax if earned personally.

**In Practice**: Slight imperfections, but generally within a few percentage points.

### Salary vs Dividend Analysis

See taxation-corporate.md for detailed analysis.

**Quick Factors**:
- Salary: Creates RRSP room, CPP contributions
- Dividends: No RRSP room, no CPP, integration applies
- Personal cash flow needs matter

**Basic Exemption**: $3,500
**Employee Rate**: 5.95%
**Maximum Employee Contribution**: $3,867.50
