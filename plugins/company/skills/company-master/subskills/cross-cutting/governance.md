# Governance

Corporate governance structures for private companies in Canada, including board design, shareholder rights, and decision-making mechanisms.

## Governance Fundamentals

### The Governance Triangle

```
Shareholders (Owners)
      |
      | elect/remove
      v
Board of Directors (Strategic Oversight)
      |
      | appoint/supervise
      v
Officers/Management (Operations)
```

### Key Relationships

**Shareholders → Board**:
- Elect directors at AGM
- Remove directors (majority vote)
- Approve fundamental changes
- Receive financial statements

**Board → Management**:
- Appoint officers
- Set strategic direction
- Approve major decisions
- Monitor performance

**Management → Operations**:
- Day-to-day decisions
- Implementation
- Report to board

## Board of Directors

### Legal Requirements

**BC (BCBCA)**:
- Minimum 1 director (private company)
- No residency requirement (private)
- Individuals only (not corporations)
- Must be 18+, not bankrupt

**Federal (CBCA)**:
- Minimum 1 director
- 25% must be Canadian residents (distributing corporations)
- Can have single director if non-distributing

### Board Composition

**Small Company (2-3 people)**:
- Often founders are only directors
- May add independent director for perspective
- Keep simple until needed

**Growth Stage**:
- Founder representation
- Investor representatives (if applicable)
- 1-2 independent directors
- Diverse perspectives

**Mature Company**:
- Majority independent
- Committees (audit, compensation, governance)
- Clear separation of Chair/CEO (often)

### Board Responsibilities

**Fiduciary Duties**:
- **Duty of Loyalty**: Act in corporation's best interest
- **Duty of Care**: Exercise reasonable diligence
- **Duty of Good Faith**: Honest and ethical conduct

**Key Functions**:
- Strategic oversight (not management)
- CEO selection and evaluation
- Risk oversight
- Financial oversight
- Major decision approval

### Board Meetings

**Frequency**: Quarterly typical for private companies
**Quorum**: Majority unless specified otherwise
**Notice**: As per bylaws/articles (often 7-14 days)
**Minutes**: Record decisions, not discussions
**Written Resolutions**: Can act without meeting (unanimous consent)

### Board Committees

**Audit Committee**:
- Financial reporting oversight
- External auditor relationship
- Internal controls
- Required for public companies

**Compensation Committee**:
- Executive compensation
- Equity plans
- Succession planning

**Governance/Nominating Committee**:
- Board composition
- Director recruitment
- Governance policies

## Shareholder Governance

### Voting Rights

**Default**: One share, one vote

**Special Share Classes**:
- Non-voting common shares
- Multiple voting shares (10:1, 100:1)
- Class voting on specific matters

**When to Use Multiple Classes**:
- Founder control despite dilution
- Public company dual-class structures
- Family control structures

### Shareholder Meetings

**Annual General Meeting (AGM)**:
- Elect directors
- Appoint auditor
- Approve financial statements
- Any other business

**Special Meetings**:
- Called for specific purposes
- Fundamental changes
- Can be requisitioned by shareholders (5% threshold)

### Shareholder Resolutions

**Ordinary Resolution**: Majority (>50%) of votes cast
**Special Resolution**: 2/3 (or 3/4 in some cases) of votes cast

**Matters Requiring Special Resolution**:
- Amend articles
- Change share structure
- Amalgamation
- Dissolution
- Sale of substantially all assets

### Written Shareholder Resolutions

- Can act without meeting
- Requires consent of all shareholders entitled to vote
- Faster for closely-held companies
- Must be documented and filed

## Unanimous Shareholder Agreements (USA)

### Purpose

Override or restrict directors' powers and transfer those powers to shareholders directly.

**Key Feature**: Binds the corporation, directors, AND future shareholders.

### Common Provisions

**Board Composition**:
- Who nominates directors
- Board seat allocation by investor/class
- Removal mechanisms

**Reserved Matters** (require shareholder approval):
- Annual budget approval
- Hiring/firing key executives
- Major contracts (over threshold)
- Debt/borrowing limits
- Equity issuance
- Related party transactions
- Fundamental changes

**Share Transfer Restrictions**:
- Right of First Refusal (ROFR)
- Right of First Offer (ROFO)
- Tag-along rights
- Drag-along rights

**Exit Mechanisms**:
- Shotgun/buy-sell provisions
- Put/call options
- Sale process requirements

**Information Rights**:
- Financial statements
- Board meeting access
- Inspection rights

### USA vs Shareholder Agreement

| Aspect | Unanimous Shareholder Agreement | Regular Shareholder Agreement |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Binding on corporation | Yes | May not be |
| Binds future shareholders | Yes (automatic) | No (must sign) |
| Restricts board powers | Yes | No |
| Filing requirement | Must note on articles | None |
| All shareholders must sign | Yes | No |

## Voting Mechanisms

### Simple Majority

- Default for most decisions
- >50% of votes cast
- Efficient but can override minorities

### Supermajority

- 2/3, 3/4, or higher threshold
- For fundamental changes
- Protects minority interests

### Unanimous Consent

- All parties must agree
- Maximum protection for minorities
- Can cause deadlock

### Class Voting

- Certain matters require approval of each class separately
- Protects class-specific interests
- E.g., no amendment to preferred share rights without preferred holders' approval

### Veto Rights

- Single party can block decision
- Usually reserved for critical matters
- Can be problematic (hold-up risk)

## Deadlock Resolution

### The Problem

Equal ownership (50/50) or supermajority requirements can cause impasse.

### Mechanisms

**Mediation**:
- Third party facilitates discussion
- Non-binding
- Preserves relationship

**Arbitration**:
- Third party decides
- Binding
- Faster than court

**Shotgun/Buy-Sell**:
- One party offers to buy or sell at stated price
- Other party must accept one side
- Forces fair pricing

**Put/Call Options**:
- Put: Right to sell shares to other shareholders
- Call: Right to buy shares from other shareholders
- Often at formula price

**Dissolution**:
- Last resort
- Wind up and distribute assets
- Destroys value

### Prevention

- Avoid 50/50 structures
- Include tie-breaking mechanisms
- Designated tie-breaker (board member, chair)
- Escalation procedures

## Director and Officer Duties

### Fiduciary Duties (Detailed)

**Duty of Loyalty**:
- Act in corporation's best interests
- Avoid conflicts of interest
- Disclose conflicts when they arise
- Don't usurp corporate opportunities

**Duty of Care**:
- Exercise care, diligence, and skill
- Standard: Reasonably prudent person
- Can rely on experts (within limits)
- Must stay informed

**Duty of Good Faith**:
- Act honestly
- Proper purposes
- Not for personal gain

### Business Judgment Rule

Directors protected if they:
- Made informed decision
- Acted in good faith
- Had no personal interest
- Rationally believed decision was in corporation's best interest

**Note**: Courts defer to business decisions, not process failures.

### Conflict of Interest

**Disclosure Required**:
- Material interest in contract/transaction
- Disclose to board
- Abstain from voting (usually)
- Transaction can still proceed if properly disclosed and approved

**Related Party Transactions**:
- Higher scrutiny
- Independent approval recommended
- Document rationale

### Personal Liability

**Protected Areas** (with business judgment rule):
- Strategic decisions
- Business investments
- Operational choices

**Liability Risks**:
- Unpaid wages (directors personally liable in many jurisdictions)
- Tax remittances (payroll source deductions)
- Environmental violations
- Fraud or bad faith

**Protection**:
- D&O insurance
- Indemnification provisions
- Due diligence defense

## Common Scenarios

### Co-Founder Governance

**Typical Structure**:
- Both founders on board
- Consider adding independent director
- Shareholder agreement for major decisions
- Clear role delineation

**Potential Issues**:
- 50/50 deadlock
- One founder wants out
- Different visions

### Investor Board Rights

**Common Terms**:
- Board seat for lead investor
- Board observer rights
- Information rights
- Protective provisions (veto rights)

**Negotiation Points**:
- Ownership threshold for board seat
- Sunset provisions
- Anti-dilution of board rights

### Family Business Governance

**Challenges**:

- Succession planning
- Next generation involvement
- Non-working shareholders

**Solutions**:
- Family council (separate from board)
- Clear policies (employment, dividends)
- Independent directors
- Shareholder agreements
