# Fundraising

Capital raising strategies for Canadian businesses, including equity, debt, and alternative financing.

## Funding Landscape

### Stages of Funding

| Stage | Typical Amount | Sources |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Pre-seed | $50K - $500K | Founders, F&F, angels |
| Seed | $500K - $2M | Angels, micro-VCs |
| Series A | $2M - $15M | VCs |
| Series B+ | $10M+ | Growth VCs, PE |
| Growth/IPO | $50M+ | Late-stage VCs, public markets |

### Funding Types

**Equity**: Sell ownership in exchange for capital
**Debt**: Borrow with obligation to repay
**Convertible**: Debt that converts to equity
**Revenue-Based**: Repay from revenue
**Grants**: Non-dilutive, non-repayable

## Equity Financing

### Common vs Preferred Shares

**Common Shares**:
- Founders and employees typically hold
- Voting rights
- Residual claim on assets
- Last in line for distributions

**Preferred Shares**:
- Investors typically hold
- Liquidation preference (paid first)
- May have additional rights (anti-dilution, dividends)
- Often converts to common (1:1 or with adjustment)

### Liquidation Preference

**1x Non-Participating**: Investor gets investment back OR converts to common (whichever is greater)

**1x Participating**: Investor gets investment back AND participates in remaining proceeds as common

**Multiple (2x, 3x)**: Investor gets 2x or 3x investment back before common shareholders

**Capped Participation**: Participates up to a cap, then converts

### Anti-Dilution Protection

**Full Ratchet**: If shares sold at lower price, investor's conversion price drops to new price (severe)

**Weighted Average**: Conversion price adjusted based on weighted average of old and new prices (more common)

**Broad-Based vs Narrow-Based**: How many shares included in weighted average calculation

### Protective Provisions

Investor veto rights over:
- New equity issuance
- Debt over threshold
- Major transactions (M&A, asset sales)
- Changes to preferred terms
- Board composition changes
- Dividend declarations

## Convertible Instruments

### SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)

**Y Combinator's SAFE**:
- Not debt (no interest, no maturity)
- Converts to equity in next priced round
- Valuation cap and/or discount
- Simpler than convertible notes

**Key Terms**:
- **Valuation Cap**: Maximum valuation for conversion
- **Discount**: % discount to next round price (e.g., 20%)
- **MFN (Most Favored Nation)**: Get terms of any better SAFE issued

**Example**:
- SAFE with $5M cap, 20% discount
- Next round at $10M pre-money
- Convert at $4M (20% discount from $5M cap, since cap < discounted price)

### Convertible Notes

**Traditional Convertible Debt**:
- IS debt (interest accrues, has maturity)
- Converts to equity at next round
- Valuation cap and/or discount

**Key Terms**:
- Interest rate (typically 4-8%)
- Maturity date (12-24 months typically)
- Conversion mechanics (automatic, optional)
- Repayment at maturity (if no round)

**Canadian Considerations**:
- Interest deductible to company
- Interest income to holder (may prefer SAFE)
- Note holder is creditor until conversion

### SAFE vs Convertible Note

| Aspect | SAFE | Convertible Note |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Legal status | Not debt | Debt |
| Interest | None | Accrues |
| Maturity | None | Has maturity date |
| Balance sheet | Equity-like | Liability |
| Complexity | Simpler | More complex |
| Cost to draft | Lower | Higher |
| Canadian preference | Increasingly popular | Traditional |

## Private Placements
