# Employment Law

BC and Canadian employment law framework for managing workforce relationships.

## Employment vs. Independent Contractor

### Why Classification Matters

**Misclassification Risks**:
- Back taxes and penalties (CPP, EI)
- Employment standards liability
- Benefits entitlements
- Termination pay obligations
- Workers' compensation claims
- Vicarious liability

### Classification Factors

**No Single Test**: Courts look at totality of relationship

**Key Factors** (Sagaz Industries test):

| Factor | Employee | Contractor |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Control | Employer controls how, when, where | Worker controls own methods |
| Tools/Equipment | Employer provides | Worker provides own |
| Integration | Core to business | Peripheral service |
| Financial Risk | No risk (fixed pay) | Profit/loss possible |
| Exclusivity | Works only for one | Multiple clients |

**CRA Factors** (Similar but tax-focused):
- Intent of parties
- Control
- Ownership of tools
- Subcontracting rights
- Financial risk
- Opportunity for profit
- Integration

### Best Practices

**For True Independent Contractors**:
- Written contractor agreement
- GST/HST registration (if >$30K)
- Own business number
- Multiple clients
- Control over schedule/methods
- Own tools and equipment
- Risk of loss (not just profit)

**Documentation**:
- Clear scope of work
- Deliverable-based payment
- No benefits/vacation
- Contractor's own insurance
- Invoicing for services

## Employment Standards (BC)

### Employment Standards Act (ESA)

**Minimum Standards**: Cannot contract below ESA minimums

**Application**: Most employees in BC (excluding federal industries)

### Hours of Work

**Standard Hours**: 8 hours/day, 40 hours/week

**Overtime**:
- After 8 hours/day: 1.5x regular rate
- After 12 hours/day: 2x regular rate
- First 8 hours on any day scheduled off: 1.5x
- After 8 hours on day scheduled off: 2x

**Averaging Agreements**: Can average hours over 2-4 weeks

**High Technology Professionals**: Exempt from overtime requirements

### Minimum Wage (BC 2024-2025)

| Category | Rate |
|----------|------|
| General | $17.40/hour |
| Liquor servers | $17.40/hour |
| Live-in camp leaders | $126.17/day |
| Resident caretakers | Monthly based on units |

### Statutory Holidays

**BC Statutory Holidays**:
- New Year's Day
- Family Day
- Good Friday
- Victoria Day
- Canada Day
- BC Day
- Labour Day
- National Day for Truth and Reconciliation
- Thanksgiving Day
- Remembrance Day
- Christmas Day

**Entitlement**: Day off with pay (or premium pay if worked)

### Vacation

| Service | Vacation Entitlement | Vacation Pay |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| After 1 year | 2 weeks | 4% of wages |
| After 5 years | 3 weeks | 6% of wages |

**Timing**: Cannot waive vacation entitlement

### Leaves of Absence

**Unpaid, Job-Protected Leaves**:

| Leave Type | Duration |
|------------|----------|
| Pregnancy | 17 weeks |
| Parental | 61 weeks (birth parent) / 62 weeks |
| Family responsibility | 5 days/year |
| Compassionate care | 27 weeks |
| Critical illness | Up to 37 weeks |
| Bereavement | 3 days |
| Domestic/sexual violence | 5 paid + 5 unpaid days |
| Jury duty | As required |

## Termination

### Notice Requirements (ESA Minimums)

| Service Length | Notice (or pay in lieu) |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| 0-3 months | None |
| 3-12 months | 1 week |
| 1-3 years | 2 weeks |
| 3+ years | 1 week per year (max 8) |

**Group Termination** (50+ employees): Additional notice requirements

### Common Law Notice

**Beyond ESA**: Courts award reasonable notice based on:
- Length of service
- Age of employee
- Character of employment
- Availability of similar employment

**Bardal Factors**: Named after foundational case

**Typical Range**: 1-24 months (exceptional cases higher)

**Rule of Thumb**: ~1 month per year of service (very approximate)

### Termination for Cause

**Standard**: Serious misconduct that fundamentally breaches employment contract

**Examples**:
- Theft or fraud
- Serious insubordination
- Violence
- Serious policy violations
- Conflict of interest

**Progressive Discipline**: Generally required unless conduct is extremely serious

**Documentation**: Essential for defending cause termination

### Constructive Dismissal

**Definition**: Employer fundamentally changes employment terms without consent

**Examples**:
- Significant pay reduction
- Demotion
- Toxic workplace
- Relocation
- Fundamental change in duties

**Employee Options**:
- Accept change
- Object and continue working (under protest)
- Treat as termination (risky—courts may disagree)

### Wrongful Dismissal Claims

**Damages Available**:
- Pay in lieu of reasonable notice
- Benefits continuation value
- Bonus/commission that would have been earned
- Extended health benefits (or equivalent)
- Aggravated damages (manner of termination)
- Punitive damages (rare)

**Duty to Mitigate**: Employee must seek comparable employment

### Termination Best Practices

1. **Review contract**: Enforceable termination provisions?
2. **Calculate entitlements**: ESA + common law exposure
3. **Prepare separation package**: Offer slightly above minimum
4. **Document carefully**: Avoid discriminatory reasons
5. **Professional delivery**: Respectful, private, with HR present
6. **Provide written terms**: Release to sign
7. **Advise of legal rights**: Suggest independent legal advice

## Employment Contracts

### Essential Terms

**Must Include**:
- Job title and duties
- Compensation
- Start date
- Reporting relationship
- Work location

**Should Include**:
- Probationary period
- Benefits eligibility
- Vacation entitlement
- Termination provisions
- Confidentiality obligations
- IP assignment
- Non-solicitation (if enforceable)
- Non-competition (rarely enforceable in BC)

### Enforceability Issues

**Termination Clauses**: Must meet or exceed ESA minimums
- Courts strictly interpret
- Ambiguity favors employee
- Must be clear and unambiguous

**Non-Competition**: Generally unenforceable in BC unless:
- Very narrowly tailored
- Reasonable time and geography
- Protecting legitimate interest
- Necessary (non-solicitation insufficient)

**Non-Solicitation**: More likely enforceable if:
- Limited time (6-24 months typical)
- Limited to actual clients/employees worked with
- Protecting legitimate relationships

### Consideration

**New Employees**: Offer letter/contract before start = sufficient consideration

**Existing Employees**: Need fresh consideration for new terms:
- Promotion
- Raise
- Bonus
- New benefits
- Continued employment (risky—may not suffice)

## Equity Compensation

### Stock Options

**Structure**:
- Grant date
- Vesting schedule (typically 4-year, 1-year cliff)
- Exercise price (usually FMV at grant)
- Expiry (typically 10 years)

**Tax Treatment** (Canada):
- CCPC: Tax on sale (not exercise)
- Non-CCPC: Tax on exercise
- Stock option deduction: 50% if conditions met

**2024 Changes**: $200K annual limit on stock option deduction (non-CCPCs)

### Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

**Structure**:
- Grant date
- Vesting schedule
- No exercise price (full value at vest)

**Tax Treatment**:
- Employment income at vesting
- FMV included in income
- No stock option deduction available

### Phantom Stock/SARs

**Structure**:
- Cash or share equivalent at vesting
- No actual shares issued
- Tracks share value

**Tax Treatment**:
- Employment income when paid
- Regular income rates (no stock option deduction)

### ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plans)

**Structure**:
- Employees contribute via payroll
- Company matches or discounts
- Periodic purchase of shares

**Tax Treatment**: Complex—depends on structure
