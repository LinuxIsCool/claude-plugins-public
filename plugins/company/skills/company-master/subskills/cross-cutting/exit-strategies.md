## Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)

### 2025 Exemption Amount

**Qualified Small Business Corporation (QSBC) shares**: $1,016,836

### QSBC Requirements

**At Sale**:
- CCPC shares
- >90% of FMV of assets used in active business (by CCPC or connected corporations)

**24-Month Hold Period**:
- Held by individual or related person for 24 months prior
- Throughout 24 months, >50% FMV of assets used in active business

### Asset Tests Explained

**90% Test (At Sale)**:
Assets must be:
- Used in active business in Canada
- Shares/debt of connected CCPCs meeting the test
- NOT: Investments, passive real estate, excess cash

**50% Test (24-Month)**:
Throughout holding period, >50% of FMV must be qualifying assets.

### Purification Strategies

If too many non-qualifying assets:

**Pay Dividends**: Extract excess cash
**Inter-company Loans**: Move cash to holding company
**Asset Sale**: Sell non-qualifying assets
**Spin-off**: Transfer non-qualifying assets to separate corporation

**Timing**: Must purify before sale, ideally well in advance

### LCGE Multiplication

**Family Trust Strategy**:
- Family trust holds CCPC shares
- On sale, trust allocates gains to beneficiaries
- Each beneficiary uses own LCGE (~$1M each)
- Family of 4 = ~$4M tax-free

**Requirements**:
- Trust properly established
- Beneficiaries are Canadian residents
- Shares meet QSBC tests
- Allocation done properly

**Anti-Avoidance**: Complex rules, get professional advice

### Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

Large LCGE claim may trigger AMT:
- Separate minimum tax calculation
- May reduce LCGE benefit in year of claim
- Can carry forward unused portion (7 years)

## M&A (Mergers & Acquisitions)

### Share Sale vs Asset Sale

**Share Sale** (Seller preference):
- Seller sells shares of corporation
- Buyer gets corporation (with all assets AND liabilities)
- Capital gains treatment for seller
- LCGE available
- Often simpler from seller perspective

**Asset Sale** (Buyer preference):
- Corporation sells its assets
- Buyer gets clean assets (can exclude liabilities)
- Buyer gets "stepped up" basis for depreciation
- Corporate tax to corporation, then distribution to shareholders
- More complex tax, often less favorable for seller

### Deal Structure

**All Cash**:
- Cleanest for seller
- Certain value
- May require financing for buyer

**Cash + Earnout**:
- Portion of price tied to future performance
- Bridges valuation gap
- Risk of disputes on earnout calculation

**Cash + Rollover Equity**:
- Seller retains some ownership in combined entity
- Tax deferral on rollover portion
- Alignment with buyer

**Stock Deal**:
- Buyer pays in its own shares
- Can defer taxes if structured properly
- Seller takes risk on buyer's stock

### Due Diligence Process

**Buyer's Diligence Areas**:
- Financial (audit, projections, working capital)
- Legal (contracts, litigation, IP)
- Tax (compliance, exposures)
- HR (employees, benefits, culture)
- Technology (IP, security, technical debt)
- Commercial (customers, market position)

**Seller Preparation**:
- Data room (virtual)
- Management presentation
- Quality of earnings analysis
- Legal representations preparation

### Purchase Agreement Key Terms

**Representations and Warranties**:
- Statements about business condition
- Seller "represents" facts are true
- Basis for indemnification claims

**Indemnification**:
- Seller indemnifies buyer for breaches
- Caps, baskets, survival periods
- Escrow or holdback for security

**Closing Conditions**:
- Regulatory approvals
- Third-party consents
- No material adverse change

**Post-Closing Adjustments**:
- Working capital adjustment
- Earnout calculations

## IPO (Initial Public Offering)

### IPO Readiness

**Financial Requirements**:
- Audited financials (2-3 years)
- Strong internal controls
- CFO with public company experience
- SEC-style disclosure readiness

**Governance Requirements**:
- Independent board members
- Audit committee
- Compensation committee
- Corporate governance policies

**Operational Requirements**:
- Scalable systems
- Management team depth
- Documented processes
- Investor relations capability

### Canadian IPO Options

**TSX (Toronto Stock Exchange)**:
- Larger companies
- Higher listing requirements
- Greater liquidity

**TSX-V (Venture Exchange)**:
- Smaller companies

**CSE (Canadian Securities Exchange)**:
- Alternative exchange
- Smaller companies
- Cannabis sector popular

**US Listing (NASDAQ, NYSE)**:

### IPO Process Timeline

1. **Preparation** (6-12 months): Build team, prepare financials

3. **Due Diligence & Prospectus** (3-4 months): Draft disclosure, audits
4. **Regulatory Review** (2-3 months): Securities commission comments
5. **Marketing** (2-3 weeks): Roadshow, investor meetings
6. **Pricing & Closing** (1 week): Price, allocate, close

- Profile and credibility

**Cons**:

## Succession Planning

### Family Succession

**Key Steps**:
1. Identify successor(s)
2. Training and development plan
3. Gradual transition of responsibilities
4. Estate freeze to shift growth to next generation
5. Buy-out of retiring generation

**Estate Freeze**:
- Exchange growth shares for fixed-value preferred
- Next generation receives common shares (via trust or directly)
- Future growth taxed to next generation
- Death of original shareholder crystallizes fixed value

**Fair Treatment of Children**:
- Active vs non-active children
- Business succession vs equal inheritance
- Insurance to equalize

### Management Buyout (MBO)

**Structure**:
- Management team buys company from existing owners
- Often financed with combination of:
  - Management equity
  - Senior debt
  - Seller financing (vendor take-back)
  - Mezzanine/subordinated debt

**Seller Considerations**:
- Price may be lower than strategic sale
- Certainty of close (management knows business)
- Legacy and employee preservation
- May retain minority stake

**Management Considerations**:
- Significant personal investment required
- Operating under debt burden
- Alignment with seller on transition

### ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership)

**In Canada**: Less common than US, but possible

**Structures**:
- Employee trust holds shares
- Share purchase plans
- Profit sharing with share purchases

**Benefits**:
- Employee retention
- Alignment with company success
- Succession alternative

## Wind-Down

### When to Wind Down

**Signs**:
- Business model not working
- Inability to reach sustainability
- Better opportunities elsewhere
- Personal reasons

- How much runway remains?
- What are creditor obligations?
- Founder opportunity cost?

### Voluntary Dissolution

**Process**:
1. Board resolution to dissolve
2. Shareholder approval (special resolution)
3. Pay creditors (or make arrangements)
4. Distribute remaining assets to shareholders
5. File articles of dissolution
6. Final tax returns

**Tax Implications**:
- Deemed disposition of assets at FMV
- Capital gain/loss to corporation
- Deemed dividend on distribution to shareholders
- Potential for capital dividend from CDA

### Bankruptcy

**When Required**:
- Unable to pay debts as they come due
- Liabilities exceed assets

**Proposal**: Negotiate with creditors (avoid bankruptcy)
**Bankruptcy**: Licensed insolvency trustee takes over

**Priority of Claims**:
1. Secured creditors
2. Trust claims (source deductions, GST)
3. Preferred claims (wages, etc.)
4. Unsecured creditors
5. Shareholders (usually nothing left)

## Valuation Methods

### Common Approaches

**Comparable Companies**:
- Revenue multiples (e.g., 2-5x revenue for SaaS)
- EBITDA multiples (e.g., 5-10x for profitable companies)
- Industry benchmarks

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**:
- Project future cash flows
- Discount to present value
- Terminal value for continuing operations

**Asset-Based**:
- Net asset value
- Liquidation value
- Useful for asset-heavy businesses

### Valuation Drivers

**Positive**:
- Revenue growth
- Profitability/margins
- Recurring revenue
- Customer retention
- Market position
- IP/technology
- Management team

**Negative**:
- Customer concentration
- Key person dependence
- Technical debt
- Legal issues
- Market decline
