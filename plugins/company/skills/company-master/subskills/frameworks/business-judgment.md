# Business Judgment

Practical business evaluation framework inspired by Dragons Den and investor mindset.

## Core Philosophy

"Brilliant ideas are worthless without brilliant execution. Show me the numbers, show me the team, show me why this wins."

## The Six Key Questions

### 1. What's the Unit Economics?

**The Fundamental Question**: Does each sale make money?

**Key Metrics**:
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: What does it cost to get one customer?
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: What's a customer worth over their lifetime?
- **Gross Margin**: Revenue minus direct costs per unit
- **Payback Period**: How long to recover CAC?

**Healthy Ratios**:
- LTV:CAC > 3:1 (ideally 5:1)
- Payback < 12 months (ideally < 6)
- Gross margin > 50% (SaaS > 70%)

**Red Flags**:
- "We'll figure out monetization later"
- "We're losing money on each sale but making it up in volume"
- No clear understanding of costs
- CAC increasing faster than LTV

### 2. Can This Scale?

**The Fundamental Question**: Can you grow without proportionally growing costs?

**Scalability Indicators**:
- Low marginal cost of delivery
- Not reliant on founder's personal effort
- Systems and processes documented
- Technology-enabled, not labor-intensive

**Questions to Ask**:
- What happens when you 10x customers?
- What breaks first?
- What costs grow linearly vs. stay fixed?
- Is there network effects or economies of scale?

**Red Flags**:
- "I personally handle every customer"
- Custom work for each client
- Linear relationship between revenue and headcount
- No automation roadmap

### 3. What's the Moat?

**The Fundamental Question**: Why can't competitors copy you?

**Types of Moats** (Warren Buffett framework):

**Network Effects**: Product gets better as more people use it
- Social networks
- Marketplaces
- Platforms

**Switching Costs**: Expensive/painful to leave
- Data lock-in
- Integrations
- Workflow dependency

**Brand**: Customers pay premium for trust
- Established reputation
- Customer loyalty
- Premium positioning

**Scale Advantages**: Larger is cheaper per unit
- Distribution
- Procurement
- R&D amortization

**Regulatory**: Legal barriers to entry
- Licenses
- Patents
- Compliance requirements

**Cost Advantage**: Can produce cheaper
- Proprietary technology
- Unique supply chain
- Better processes

### 4. Who Are You Competing With?

**The Fundamental Question**: How do you win against alternatives?

**Competition Framework**:

**Direct Competitors**: Same solution, same customer
- Who else does exactly this?
- What's your differentiation?

**Indirect Competitors**: Different solution, same problem
- What else could customers use?
- Why is your approach better?

**Status Quo**: Customer does nothing
- Why change from current behavior?
- What's the cost of inaction?

**Questions to Ask**:
- Who loses if you win?
- What would a well-funded competitor do?
- What's your sustainable advantage?

**Red Flags**:
- "We have no competition" (you do, or there's no market)
- Differentiation is easily copied
- Competing on price alone
- Ignoring indirect competition

### 5. What's the Path to Profitability?

**The Fundamental Question**: When and how will this make money?

**Stages**:
1. **Prove Product**: Does anyone want this?
2. **Prove Unit Economics**: Can you make money per sale?
3. **Prove Scale**: Can you grow while maintaining economics?
4. **Achieve Profitability**: Revenue > Costs

**Questions to Ask**:
- What's the timeline to profitability?
- What needs to happen at each stage?
- What resources are required?
- What are the key risks?

**Red Flags**:
- "We'll figure that out later"
- Profitability always 18+ months away
- No clear milestones
- Requires "magic" growth assumptions

### 6. Do You Have the Team?

**The Fundamental Question**: Can these people actually execute?

**Team Evaluation**:

**Founder-Market Fit**:
- Why are these founders building this?
- What unique insight do they have?
- Have they lived this problem?

**Complementary Skills**:
- Is there product/sales/tech coverage?
- Who's missing?
- Are they aware of gaps?

**Execution History**:
- Have they built before?
- How do they handle adversity?
- References from past colleagues?

**Coachability**:
- Do they listen to feedback?
- Can they adapt?
- Are they honest about challenges?

**Red Flags**:
- Founders can't explain their own numbers
- Team has obvious gaps they don't acknowledge
- Everyone has same background/perspective
- Defensiveness about weaknesses

## The Due Diligence Framework

### Quick Assessment (30 seconds)

1. What does this company do? (Can they explain simply?)
2. Who is the customer? (Specific and identifiable?)
3. What's the revenue model? (Clear path to money?)
4. Why now? (Why is timing right?)

### Deeper Dive (30 minutes)

**Market**:
- Size (TAM, SAM, SOM)
- Growth rate
- Dynamics and trends

**Business Model**:
- Revenue streams
- Pricing strategy
- Unit economics

**Traction**:
- Revenue/users
- Growth rate
- Retention metrics

**Competition**:
- Landscape
- Differentiation
- Sustainable advantage

**Team**:
- Background
- Roles and gaps
- Culture and values

**Financials**:
- Historical performance
- Projections and assumptions
- Capital needs

### Deal Evaluation

**Valuation Assessment**:
- What's being asked?
- What comparables suggest?
- What's the return potential?

**Risk Assessment**:
- What could go wrong?
- How are risks mitigated?
- What's the downside?

**Terms Assessment**:
- Are terms fair?
- Unusual provisions?
- Alignment with interests?

## Pattern Recognition

### Positive Patterns

**Founder Obsession**: Founders who can't stop thinking about the problem

**Customer Pull**: Customers asking for the product vs. founders pushing

**Natural Growth**: Growing without heavy marketing spend

**Repeatable Wins**: Same playbook works repeatedly

**Team Quality**: Great people who could work anywhere choosing this

### Warning Patterns

**"We Just Need..."**: Always one more thing before success

**Pivot History**: Multiple dramatic direction changes

**Vanity Metrics**: Big numbers that don't matter (downloads, pageviews without engagement)

**Excuses**: External factors always blamed

**Secrecy**: Won't share key information

## Common Mistakes

### Founder Mistakes

1. **Building Without Validation**: "I know customers want this"
2. **Feature Obsession**: More features vs. solving core problem
3. **Premature Scaling**: Growing before product-market fit
4. **Ignoring Unit Economics**: Growing unprofitably
5. **Wrong Hires**: Hiring for role vs. fit
6. **Running Out of Cash**: Not raising when you can, not cutting when you should

### Investor Mistakes

1. **Pattern Matching**: "This looks like Uber for X"
2. **Ignoring Red Flags**: Hoping problems go away
3. **Valuation FOMO**: Paying too much because others are
4. **Team Fit Ignored**: Great idea, wrong team
5. **Market Size Fantasy**: "If we just get 1% of..."

## Decision Framework

### The Investment Test

Would you invest your own money in this?

**If Yes**:
- You understand the business
- You believe in the team
- You see the path to success
- The risk/reward makes sense

**If No**:
- What's missing?
- Can it be fixed?
- Is it a pass or a "not yet"?

### The Regret Test

If this succeeds without you, will you regret not participating?

**High Regret**: Likely a real opportunity
**Low Regret**: Probably right to pass

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### With First Principles

Business judgment evaluates what first principles generates. First principles creates options; judgment filters them.

### With Leverage Analysis

Judgment asks "will this work?" Leverage asks "will it scale?"

### With Governance Thinking

Good business with bad governance eventually fails. Both matter.

## Disclaimer

Business judgment is developed through experience. These frameworks provide structure, but real judgment comes from seeing many businesses succeed and fail. When in doubt, consult experienced advisors and do more diligence.
