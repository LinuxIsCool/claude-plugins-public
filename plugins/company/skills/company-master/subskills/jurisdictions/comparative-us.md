# Comparative: United States

US business structures and considerations for Canadian companies with US nexus.

## Why US Structure Matters

### Common Scenarios

1. **US Investors**: VCs prefer Delaware C-corps
2. **US Customers**: May require US entity for contracting
3. **US Employees**: Need US payroll entity
4. **US Market Entry**: Sales, marketing, operations
5. **Future Exit**: US acquirers prefer US targets

### The Delaware Standard

**Why Delaware**:
- Sophisticated corporate law (Court of Chancery)
- Predictable judicial precedent
- Business-friendly environment
- VC familiarity and documentation
- Franchise tax structure (favorable for most)

**Reality**: ~65% of Fortune 500 incorporated in Delaware

## Entity Types

### C Corporation

**What It Is**: Standard corporation, taxed at entity level

**Key Features**:
- Separate legal entity
- Limited liability
- Freely transferable shares
- Unlimited shareholders
- Multiple share classes allowed

**Tax Treatment**:
- Corporate tax on profits (21% federal)
- Shareholder tax on dividends
- "Double taxation" but often deferred

**Best For**: VC-backed companies, public companies, companies with complex cap tables

### S Corporation

**What It Is**: Corporation with pass-through taxation

**Requirements**:
- <100 shareholders
- Only US citizens/residents as shareholders
- One class of stock only
- No corporate or foreign shareholders

**Tax Treatment**:
- No entity-level federal tax
- Income passes through to shareholders
- Shareholders report on personal returns

**Limitations**: Cannot have Canadian parent or shareholders

**Best For**: US-only closely-held businesses

### Limited Liability Company (LLC)

**What It Is**: Flexible entity combining corporate protection with partnership taxation

**Key Features**:
- Limited liability
- Flexible governance (operating agreement)
- Pass-through default taxation
- Can elect corporate taxation
- Flexible profit/loss allocation

**Tax Treatment** (default):
- Single-member: Disregarded (Schedule C)
- Multi-member: Partnership
- Can elect: S-corp or C-corp treatment

**For Canadians**: Generally unfavorable—US LLC may be taxed as corporation in Canada while being transparent in US

### Limited Partnership (LP)

**Structure**: General partner (liability) + limited partners (investors)

**Common Use**: VC/PE fund structure

**For Operating Companies**: Rarely used (use LLC instead)

## Delaware C-Corp Deep Dive

### Incorporation

**Process**:
1. File Certificate of Incorporation with Delaware Secretary of State
2. Adopt Bylaws
3. Hold organizational meeting
4. Issue shares

**Cost**:
- State filing: $89+
- Registered agent: $50-300/year
- Franchise tax: Varies (see below)

**Timeline**: Same-day filing available

### Capitalization

**Authorized vs Issued**:
- Authorized shares: Maximum allowed by charter
- Issued shares: Actually outstanding
- Typical: 10M authorized, issue 8M to founders

**Par Value**:
- Nominal value stated in charter
- Typically $0.0001 or $0.00001
- Affects franchise tax calculation

### Stock Classes

**Common Stock**:
- Founders, employees
- Voting rights
- Residual value after preferences

**Preferred Stock**:
- Investors
- Liquidation preference
- Anti-dilution protection
- Conversion rights
- Typically non-voting except protective provisions

### 83(b) Election

**Critical for Founders**

**Situation**: Stock subject to vesting (risk of forfeiture)

**Default**: Taxed on vesting at FMV minus price paid

**83(b) Election**: Elect to be taxed immediately at grant

**Benefit**: If stock appreciates, no tax on appreciation when vesting occurs

**Timing**: Must file within 30 days of grant—NO EXTENSIONS

**Example**:
- Grant 1M shares at $0.001/share
- 83(b) election: Pay tax on $1,000 (negligible)
- Without 83(b): If shares worth $1/share at vesting, pay tax on $1M

### Delaware Franchise Tax

**Two Methods** (pay lower):

**Authorized Shares Method**:
| Shares | Annual Tax |
|--------|------------|
| ≤5,000 | $175 |
| 5,001-10,000 | $250 |
| Each add'l 10K | $85 |
| Max | $200,000 |

**Assumed Par Value Capital Method**:
- (Authorized shares × Par value) + (Issued shares × Paid-in capital)
- Tax rate varies by total

**For Startups**: Usually $400-800/year with proper structure

## US Tax Considerations

### Corporate Tax

**Federal Rate**: 21% flat rate

**State Taxes**: Vary by state
- Delaware: 8.7% (but only on Delaware income)
- California: 8.84%
- No corporate tax: WY, NV, SD, TX (margin tax)

### QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock)

**Massive Tax Benefit**: Exclude gain on sale of QSBS

**Requirements**:
- C corporation
- <$50M aggregate gross assets
- Active business (not investment, professional services)
- Stock held >5 years
- Original issuance to taxpayer

**Exclusion**:
- 100% exclusion for stock acquired after Sept 2010
- Up to greater of: $10M or 10x basis

**Example**:
- Founder invests $1,000
- Sells for $10M after 5 years
- $0 federal tax on $10M gain

**For Canadians**: Only benefits US taxpayers; Canadian tax still applies

### Transfer Pricing

**US-Canada**: Arm's length standard applies

**Common Issues**:
- Management fees
- IP licensing
- Intercompany services
- Cost sharing arrangements

**Documentation**: Required to avoid penalties

## VC Financing Structures

### Standard Documents (NVCA)

**Term Sheet**: Non-binding summary of terms

**Definitive Documents**:
- Stock Purchase Agreement
- Investors' Rights Agreement
- Right of First Refusal and Co-Sale Agreement
- Voting Agreement
- Certificate of Incorporation (Amended)

### Key Terms

**Liquidation Preference**:
- 1x non-participating: Get money back or convert
- 1x participating: Get money back AND share remainder
- Multiple preferences: 2x, 3x (rare now)

**Anti-Dilution**:
- Weighted average: Standard
- Full ratchet: Aggressive (rare)

**Protective Provisions**: Investor consent required for:
- New financing
- Sale of company
- Change to charter
- Dividends
- Debt above threshold

**Board Composition**: Typically:
- Seed: 3 (2 founders, 1 investor)
- Series A: 5 (2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent)

### Option Pool

**Pre-Money Option Pool**:
- Created before investment
- Dilutes founders only
- "Option pool shuffle"

**Standard Size**: 10-20% of post-financing capitalization

## Canadian-US Structures

### Flip (Canadian to US)

**What It Is**: Canadian company becomes subsidiary of US parent

**Process**:
1. Form Delaware parent
2. Exchange Canadian shares for US parent shares
3. Canadian company becomes wholly-owned subsidiary

**Tax Implications**:
- Section 85 rollover (defer Canadian tax)
- Complex planning required
- CCPC status lost

**When to Flip**:
- US institutional investor requirement
- US acquisition target
- US IPO planned

### US Subsidiary

**What It Is**: Canadian parent owns US subsidiary

**Uses**:
- US employees
- US sales/marketing
- US customer contracts

**Tax Considerations**:
- Transfer pricing
- Subpart F / GILTI (US tax on Canadian parent's US income)
- Treaty benefits

### Branch vs Subsidiary

**Branch** (Direct operations):
- Simpler
- US income taxed in Canada with FTC
- Full liability exposure

**Subsidiary**:
- Limited liability
- More complex
- Deferral possible but limited (GILTI)

## Employment

### At-Will Employment

**US Default**: Employment can be terminated at any time for any reason (except illegal reasons)

**No Notice Required**: Unlike Canada

**Exceptions**:
- Discrimination (protected classes)
- Contract provisions
- Some state exceptions (Montana)

### Stock Options

**Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)**:
- Favorable tax treatment
- Employees only
- $100K annual limit
- AMT implications

**Non-Qualified Stock Options (NQSOs)**:
- Ordinary income on exercise
- Anyone can receive
- No annual limit
- Simpler

### State Laws

**California**:
- Non-competes generally unenforceable
- Unique labor laws
- Must offer health insurance (ACA)

**Texas**:
- More employer-friendly
- Non-competes enforceable if reasonable
- No state income tax

## Practical Considerations

### Registered Agent

**Requirement**: Must have registered agent in state of incorporation

**Delaware**: Many services available ($50-300/year)

### Qualifying in Other States

**Foreign Qualification**: If doing business in another state, must register there

**Triggers**:
- Employees in state
- Office in state
- Significant sales

### Banking

**US Bank Account**:
- Harder for non-US persons to open
- May require in-person visit
- Some fintechs offer remote opening

**EIN**: Required for US tax purposes (apply online or by mail)

### Annual Compliance

**Delaware**:
- Franchise tax (March 1)
- Annual report (concurrent)

**Federal**:
- Form 1120 (corporate tax return)
- Various information returns

**State** (where qualified):
- Annual reports
- State tax returns

## When to Pursue US Structure

### Good Reasons

- US institutional VC investment
- US acquisition exit planned
- Significant US operations
- US employees
- QSBS benefits (for US founders)

### Reconsider If

- No US nexus
- Canadian investors only
- Canadian operations only
- Want SR&ED and CCPC benefits
- Complex structure not justified

## Integration with Other Skills

### With Corporations

Compare CBCA/BCBCA with Delaware corporate law

### With Fundraising

US VCs expect Delaware; structure accordingly

### With Exit Strategies

US M&A market preferences affect exit planning

## Disclaimer

US law varies by state and is complex. This sub-skill provides general overview for Canadian founders considering US structures. US tax and corporate matters require US-qualified professionals. Cross-border structures require both Canadian and US expertise.
