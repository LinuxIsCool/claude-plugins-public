- Permanent establishment
- VAT registration

- EIS/SEIS eligibility possible

### Tax Treaty

**Canada-UK Tax Treaty**:

## Practical Considerations

### Registered Office

**Requirement**: Must have UK address

**Options**:
- Accountant's office
- Registered office service
- Physical office (if have one)

### Bank Account

**UK Bank Account**:
- Traditional banks (Barclays, HSBC, etc.)
- Challengers (Monzo Business, Starling, Revolut)
- Often easier to open than US

**KYC**: Requires identification, proof of business

### Accounting Standards

**Options for Small Companies**:
- FRS 102 Section 1A (Micro-entities)
- FRS 102 (Small entities)
- Full IFRS (optional for private)

**Filing**: Annual accounts with Companies House (public record)

### Annual Compliance

**Companies House**:
- Confirmation statement (annual): £13-34
- Annual accounts (within 9 months of year-end)

**HMRC**:
- Corporation tax return (within 12 months of period end)
- Corporation tax payment (9 months + 1 day after period end)

**Penalties**: Late filing penalties can be significant

## Post-Brexit Considerations

### Trade with EU

**No Longer Single Market**: Customs declarations required

**Services**: More complex, vary by member state

**Data Transfers**: UK adequacy decision in place (for now)

### Immigration

**Visa Requirements**: Work visas needed for many EU nationals

**Global Talent Visa**: Fast track for tech talent

**Skilled Worker Visa**: Points-based system

### Regulatory Divergence

**Data Protection**: UK GDPR (similar but separate from EU)

**Product Standards**: Still aligned but may diverge

**Financial Services**: Equivalence decisions vary by area

## When to Consider UK

### Good Reasons

- UK customer concentration
- UK investor interest (EIS/SEIS attractive)
- European headquarters
- Access to UK talent
- London capital markets

### Reconsider If

- Primary market is EU (consider Ireland or Netherlands)
- No UK nexus
- Complexity not justified by opportunity

## Comparison with Canada

| Factor | UK | Canada (BC) |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Corporation tax | 19-25% | 11-27% |
| Investor incentives | EIS/SEIS (strong) | None comparable |
| R&D credits | RDEC/SME | SR&ED |
| Employment | Stronger employee rights | Varies by province |
| Annual compliance | More disclosure | Less public |

## Integration with Other Skills

## Disclaimer

UK law changes frequently, especially post-Brexit. This sub-skill provides general UK framework guidance. UK matters require UK-qualified professionals (solicitors, accountants). Cross-border structures need both Canadian and UK expertise.
