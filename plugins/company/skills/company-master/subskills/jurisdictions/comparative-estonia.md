## Why Estonia?

- Crypto/blockchain projects

## E-Residency Program

### What It Is

**Digital Identity**: Government-issued digital ID for non-residents

**Not**: A visa, citizenship, or residence permit

- Open Estonian company
- Open Estonian bank account
- Sign documents digitally
- File taxes online
- Access EU payment services

### Application Process

**Steps**:
1. Apply online (e-resident.gov.ee)
2. Pay fee (€100-120)
3. Background check (2-8 weeks)
4. Pick up digital ID card (Estonian embassy or collection point)

**Requirements**:
- Valid reason (business intention)
- No criminal background issues
- Valid passport

**Collection Points**: Various worldwide locations including:
- London, UK
- San Francisco, US
- Tokyo, Japan

### Digital ID Card

**Contents**:

- Card reader
- PIN codes

**Uses**:
- Digital signatures (legally equivalent to handwritten in EU)
- Encrypted communication
- Identity verification
- Access to Estonian e-services

## Estonian Company (OÜ)

### Osaühing (OÜ)

**Private Limited Company**: Most common for e-residents

**Key Features**:
- Limited liability
- Minimum share capital: €2,500 (can be unpaid initially)
- Minimum 1 founder
- No residency requirements
- Managed entirely online

### Formation

**Process**:
1. Reserve company name (Business Register)
2. Draft articles of association
3. Pay share capital (€2,500, can be deferred)
4. Register digitally with e-signature
5. Registration complete (usually 1-2 days)

**Costs**:
- State fee: €265
- Service providers: €400-1,000+ (optional but helpful)

**Timeline**: Can be completed in 24-48 hours

### Share Capital

**Minimum**: €2,500

**Deferral Option**: Can start without paying in full
- Must pay before distributing profits
- 5-year deadline

**For Digital Businesses**: Often minimal actual capital needed

### Management Structure

**Management Board** (Juhatus):
- At least 1 member
- Represents company
- Can be non-resident

**Supervisory Board** (Nõukogu):
- Optional for small companies
- Required if share capital >€25,000 and >2 board members

### Virtual Office

**Legal Address Required**: In Estonia

**Options**:
- Service provider virtual address (common)
- Accountant's address
- Physical office (rare for e-residents)

**Note**: This is not a sham—legal mail, government communications go here

## Taxation

### Corporate Income Tax

**Unique System**: 0% on retained earnings, tax only on distributions

**Rate**: 20/80 = 25% effective rate on distributions

**Regular Distributions**: Reduced rate 14/86 ≈ 16.3% (on dividends up to prior year's average)

**How It Works**:
```
Profit earned: €100,000
Retained in company: €0 tax
Distributed as dividend: €20,000 tax (on €100,000 gross)
Net to shareholder: €80,000
```

### Implications

**Cash Flow Benefit**: Tax deferred until distribution

**Reinvestment**: Grow company tax-free

**Salary vs Dividend**:
- Salary: Social taxes (~33% employer cost)
- Dividend: 20% corporate tax + personal tax in residence country

### Personal Tax

**E-Residents**: Not tax residents of Estonia
- Taxed in country of residence
- Estonia-source income may have Estonian withholding

**Tax Treaties**: Estonia has treaties with 60+ countries (including Canada)

### VAT

**Standard Rate**: 22%

**Registration**: Required if Estonian turnover >€40,000

**Reverse Charge**: For B2B services within EU

**Digital Services**: Complex VAT rules for B2C across EU (MOSS/OSS system)

## Banking

### Traditional Banks

**Challenge**: Estonian banks increasingly hesitant with e-residents

**Requirements**:
- In-person visit (sometimes)
- Clear business case
- Substance (real operations)

**Banks**:
- LHV (most e-resident friendly)
- Swedbank
- SEB

### Fintech Alternatives

**More Accessible**:
- Wise Business (popular with e-residents)
- Payoneer
- Revolut Business
- Mercury (US)

**Limitations**: May not be full banking (no loans, etc.)

### Payment Processors

**Stripe**: Available for Estonian companies
**PayPal**: Available
**Other EU Processors**: Generally accessible

## Compliance

### Annual Obligations

**Annual Report**:
- Due within 6 months of year-end
- Filed electronically
- Must be approved by shareholders

**Contents**:
- Balance sheet
- Income statement
- Notes
- Management report (sometimes)

**Audit**: Required only for larger companies

### Accounting

**Requirement**: Must maintain books according to Estonian accounting law

**Options**:
- DIY (possible for simple businesses)
- Estonian accountant (common)
- Service providers (common for e-residents)

**Cost**: €50-300/month for basic accounting

### Substance Requirements

**No Minimum**: But increasingly scrutinized

**Expectations**:
- Real business activities
- Not just for tax benefits
- May need to demonstrate value creation

**Trend**: Estonia (and EU) cracking down on shell companies

## Practical Considerations

### Service Providers

**E-Residency Ecosystem**: Many service providers targeting e-residents

**Typical Bundle**:
- Company formation
- Virtual office
- Accounting
- Banking assistance
- Annual reporting

**Examples**:
- Xolo (popular, full-service)
- 1Office
- LeapIN
- e-Residency Hub partners

**Costs**: €100-500/month for full service

### Digital Signing

**e-Signature**: Legally binding throughout EU

**Process**:
- Sign with digital ID
- Timestamp applied
- Legally equivalent to physical signature

**Documents**: Contracts, invoices, corporate resolutions

### Communication

**Language**: Estonian (official), but English widely used

**Government**: English interfaces available

**Banking**: Often Estonian-only forms (service providers help)

## Use Cases

### Freelancer/Consultant

**Setup**: OÜ + accounting service

**Benefits**:
- Professional EU company
- Issue EU invoices
- Accept EU payments
- Retained earnings taxation

**Tax Planning**: Work with home country tax advisor

### SaaS Business

**Setup**: OÜ + Stripe + accounting

**Benefits**:
- 0% on retained earnings
- EU VAT handling (OSS)
- Stripe for payments
- Digital management

### Digital Nomad

**Setup**: OÜ + fintech banking + virtual office

**Benefits**:
- Location-independent management
- EU company credentials
- Easier European clients

**Reality Check**: Still taxed in country of residence (wherever that is)

## Canada-Estonia Considerations

### Tax Treaty

**Canada-Estonia Tax Treaty**: In effect

**Dividends**: 5-15% withholding
**Interest**: 10%
**Royalties**: 10%

### For Canadian Tax Residents

**FAPI Risk**: Estonian company income may be FAPI
- Passive income taxed currently in Canada
- Active business may defer

**CFC Rules**: Canadian foreign affiliate rules apply

**Reporting**: T1134, T1135 obligations

### Structure Considerations

**Estonian Subsidiary**: Canadian parent owns Estonian OÜ
- Operational flexibility
- FAPI analysis needed
- Transfer pricing

**Direct Ownership**: Individual owns OÜ
- Simpler
- Personal tax in Canada on distributions
- FAPI risk if passive

## Limitations

### What Estonia Is Not

**Not a Tax Haven**:
- Full EU member
- OECD compliant
- CRS reporting
- Increasingly scrutinized

**Not Residence/Visa**:
- E-Residency doesn't let you live in Estonia
- Need separate visa/permit for that

**Not Banking Guarantee**:
- Banking increasingly difficult
- Real substance increasingly expected

### Red Flags

**Don't Use For**:
- Tax evasion
- Shell company with no substance
- Hiding assets
- Avoiding home country obligations

**Will Likely Fail**:
- Opening if obviously no real business
- Banking without real operations
- Maintaining without proper reporting

## Comparison with Other Jurisdictions

| Factor | Estonia | Delaware | UK | Canada (BC) |

## When to Consider Estonia

### Good Fit

- Location-independent digital business
- EU clients/market focus
- Want to retain and reinvest profits
- Comfortable with digital-first
- Have clear business purpose

### Poor Fit

- Need easy banking (consider alternatives)
- Primary market is North America (US structure better)
- Physical goods/inventory
- Complex operations requiring local presence
- Tax evasion motivation (will backfire)

## Integration with Other Skills

### With DAOs/DUNAs

Estonia explored as jurisdiction for DAOs

### With Taxation-International

Cross-border planning with Estonian entity

### With Compliance

Different compliance framework than Canada

## Disclaimer

Estonia's digital business environment is innovative but has limitations. E-Residency is not a tax strategy—you remain taxed in your country of residence. Estonian company structures must serve genuine business purposes. Substance requirements are increasing. Consult Estonian and Canadian tax/legal professionals before establishing structures.
