# Self-Assessment - Measuring Your Progress

Evaluate your skill development abilities and identify growth areas.

## Purpose

Self-assessment helps you:
- Understand your current level honestly
- Identify specific areas for improvement
- Track progress over time
- Set meaningful learning goals

## Assessment Framework

### Dimension 1: Technical Proficiency

Rate yourself 1-5 on each:

| Capability | 1 (Learning) | 3 (Competent) | 5 (Expert) |
|------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **Frontmatter** | Can't recall fields | Use common fields | Know all fields + edge cases |
| **Descriptions** | Vague, don't trigger | Usually trigger correctly | Precise, reliable triggering |
| **Instructions** | Unclear, Claude struggles | Claude follows mostly | Crystal clear, handles edges |
| **Structure** | Basic SKILL.md only | Use subskills sometimes | Progressive disclosure mastery |
| **Debugging** | Need help debugging | Can debug common issues | Debug and prevent issues |

**Your scores**: __ / __ / __ / __ / __
**Average**: __

### Dimension 2: Design Thinking

Rate yourself 1-5:

| Capability | 1 (Learning) | 3 (Competent) | 5 (Expert) |
|------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **Scoping** | Skills too broad/narrow | Reasonable scope | Perfect scope for purpose |
| **User Empathy** | Write for myself | Consider other users | Design for diverse users |
| **Failure Handling** | Happy path only | Handle common failures | Graceful degradation everywhere |
| **Evolution** | Create and forget | Update occasionally | Continuous improvement |
| **Composition** | Single skills only | Basic composition | Orchestrated skill systems |

**Your scores**: __ / __ / __ / __ / __
**Average**: __

### Dimension 3: Meta-Skills

Rate yourself 1-5:

| Capability | 1 (Learning) | 3 (Competent) | 5 (Expert) |
|------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **Learning** | Need guidance | Learn independently | Discover new techniques |
| **Teaching** | Can't explain | Explain basics | Mentor others effectively |
| **Architecture** | Individual skills | Related skill sets | Domain architectures |
| **Contribution** | Consumer only | Share occasionally | Active ecosystem contributor |

**Your scores**: __ / __ / __ / __
**Average**: __

## Proficiency Level Mapping

### Total Score Interpretation

Add your three dimension averages:

| Total | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 3-5 | Novice | Learning fundamentals |
| 6-8 | Practitioner | Capable and growing |
| 9-11 | Expert | Advanced, teaches others |
| 12-15 | Master | Designs systems, leads |

## Diagnostic Exercises

### Exercise 1: Blind Skill Creation

Without referring to any documentation:
1. Create a complete skill from scratch
2. Test it works
3. Note where you got stuck

**What this reveals**: Your internalized knowledge vs. reference-dependent knowledge.

### Exercise 2: Skill Critique

Take someone else's skill and:
1. List 3 things done well
2. List 3 areas for improvement
3. Rewrite the description

**What this reveals**: Your pattern recognition and improvement suggestions.

### Exercise 3: Teaching Simulation

Explain to a rubber duck (or real person):
1. What a skill is
2. How discovery works
3. How to write a good description

**What this reveals**: Depth of your understanding (teaching exposes gaps).

### Exercise 4: Architecture Challenge

Given a domain you don't know well:
1. Research for 10 minutes
2. Propose 5 skills that would help
3. Map their relationships

**What this reveals**: Your ability to apply skill thinking to new domains.

## Growth Planning

### Identify Your Edge

Look at your lowest-scoring dimensions. These are your growth edges.

**If Technical Proficiency is lowest**:
- Read frontmatter-reference thoroughly
- Practice creating varied skills
- Study existing skills in the ecosystem

**If Design Thinking is lowest**:
- Focus on user empathy exercises
- Practice failure mode analysis
- Study skill composition patterns

**If Meta-Skills is lowest**:
- Teach someone else
- Contribute to ecosystem
- Attempt domain architecture

### Set Specific Goals

Use this template:

```
Current Level: [Novice/Practitioner/Expert]
Target Level: [Next level up]
Timeframe: [Realistic period]

Specific Goals:
1. [Measurable goal related to weakness]
2. [Measurable goal related to weakness]
3. [Stretch goal]

Success Criteria:
- [How you'll know you've achieved goal 1]
- [How you'll know you've achieved goal 2]
- [How you'll know you've achieved goal 3]
```

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Reflection

Each week, note:
1. Skills created/modified
2. What went well
3. What was challenging
4. One thing learned

### Monthly Assessment

Each month, re-take this assessment:
- Track score changes
- Celebrate improvements
- Adjust goals if needed

### Quarterly Review

Each quarter:
- Review skills you've created
- Assess their usage and impact
- Plan next quarter's focus

## Feedback Loops

### Getting Feedback

- **Ask Claude**: "Review this skill for best practices"
- **Ask peers**: Share skills with other developers
- **Test with users**: Do others trigger your skills correctly?
- **Analyze failures**: When skills don't work, why?

### Giving Feedback

When reviewing others' skills:
1. Start with what works
2. Be specific about improvements
3. Explain the "why" not just "what"
4. Offer alternatives, not just criticism

## Checkpoint Questions

Answer honestly:

1. **Can you create a skill without documentation?**
   - [ ] No, I need to look things up
   - [ ] Yes, for basic skills
   - [ ] Yes, including advanced patterns

2. **Do your skills trigger correctly first time?**
   - [ ] Rarely
   - [ ] Usually
   - [ ] Almost always

3. **Have you taught someone else to create skills?**
   - [ ] No
   - [ ] Attempted
   - [ ] Successfully

4. **Have you designed a skill architecture?**
