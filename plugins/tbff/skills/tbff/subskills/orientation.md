# TBFF Orientation

## The Vision

Threshold-Based Flow Funding is about creating **conditions for abundance** that can only grow at the rate abundance expands.

From the founding conversation (Jan 22, 2026):

> "We're trying to move away from 'I need you to invest in my company, my logo, my brand.' Instead, we're saying: invest in these groups of humans who are brilliant, who are experimenting together, who hold their ideas tightly but loosely at the same time—able to compost them together and iterate."

## Core Metaphor: The Orchard vs The Forest

**Standard Model**: Build a monocrop apple orchard covered in pesticides to produce a thousand apples.

**TBFF Model**: Grow a healthy forest where the *byproduct* is perhaps some apple trees, maybe mangoes, pineapples, kale—whatever emerges from a thriving ecosystem.

The shift is from investing in specific companies to investing in **ecosystems**, which ultimately means investing in **individual people**.

## Key Concepts

### Interactability > Interoperability

- **Interoperable** = form (things that tie together technically)
- **Interchangeable** = function (components that can be swapped)
- **Interactable** = context (what matters when you need to retain meaning across boundaries)

This is a **sociotechnical problem** about human coordination, not just technology.

### Simple Rules → Complex Emergence

Christina's principle: Simple rules enable complex emergence, while complex rules create simple behavior.

From Social Roots research: You need **three layers minimum** for complex emergence:
- Subgroups
- Groups
- Groups of groups

With only two layers, you get either a sponge (all cells the same) or cancer (one cell controlling everything).

### The Person-Experiment Node

Each node in the network could be a **key pair representing person + experiment**:
- Any individual can represent multiple experiments
- Any experiment can be represented by multiple people
- When you fund something, you're saying: "I trust this person on this experiment"

## The Participants

### Initial Networks

1. **MycoFi** - Christina's network
2. **ARG** (Atlas Research Group) - Dylan's network (~6 people starting)
3. **ZK Network** - Godfrey's zero-knowledge infrastructure
4. **Kevin's network** - Emerging

People can participate in multiple networks. The question isn't "how many people?" but "how do these networks interact while maintaining their own community pools and governance?"

### Key People

- **Christina Bowen** - Mechanism designer, spreadsheet architect
- **Dylan** - Federation vision, ARG lead, hardware focus
- **Jeff** - Connection to ZK Network, Davos observer
- **Shawn (you)** - Claude Code integration, skill-based implementation

## The Federation

The Federation is the **long-term goal**—a federated architecture that will fund and build the ecosystems they need, designed to eventually dissolve into something common and non-extractable.

Dylan's membrane model:
```
Federation ($1M inflow)
    ↓
[ARG] ←→ [MycoFi]     ← First membrane
    ↓
[Commons] [GuildNet] [Mapping]    ← Sub-pools with own rules
    ↓
[Individuals] ←→ [Individuals]    ← Can flow to each other
```

## Hardware First

ARG's differentiator: Almost no one in the regenerative space is focusing on **hardware**. They're building a distributed cloud on their own hardware architecture.

Partners:
- Companion Intelligence (Liam's company)
- Chimera Computing
- Both connected to AMD with access to hardware solutions

Three core applications planned:
1. **Access to the Commons** - General storage and data access
2. **GuildNet** - Coordination, collaboration, learning layer
3. **Mapping Tools** - Visualization and sense-making

## Demo Context

**Date**: Thursday, January 29, 2026
**Audience**: Christina and Dylan
**Goal**: Show working TBFF interfaces

From the transcript's action items:
1. Christina and Dylan: Mock up minimum viable UI for flow funding interface
2. Shawn: Build whatever prototype speaks to him, informed by spreadsheet constraints
3. Everyone: Combine ideas and do show and tell

Shawn's goal: "Finding the simplest possible implementation that covers all the bases."
