- Fix grammatical issues from spoken language
- Create logical section breaks with descriptive headers
- Maintain the speaker's voice and intent
- Preserve important quotes and key phrases
- Use markdown formatting (headers, lists, emphasis) appropriately
- Do not truncate or summarize - include ALL content from the original
