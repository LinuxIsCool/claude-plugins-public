## Question Selection Heuristics

1. **Start broad, narrow as you learn**
2. **Follow energy** - dig into what the user is enthusiastic or concerned about
3. **Challenge assumptions** - gently probe when something seems taken for granted
4. **Balance positive and negative** - explore both hopes and fears
5. **Get concrete** - ask for examples when answers are abstract
6. **Respect the budget** - save consolidation questions for the end
